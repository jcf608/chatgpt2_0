The Spirit of Gluttony
In life, he had been fat. No, more than fat. He had been hugely obese, his body heavy and powerful. He honestly couldn't recall much about his body beyond those facts - death had stripped that from him - he could only recall that he had been enormous. He knew that he had been handsome at one point, and desired by both men and women, but his own desire, no, his need, was to grow huge, and that consumed nearly all other desires until all that was left was his urge to feed and his need for sex. When his size turned away most, some of his lovers persisted, and helped him to continue his growth - larger, ever larger. His interests had zeroed in on the things that brought him the most pleasure - growing and sex. Death had been a surprise, unexpected and unwanted. Even death however, did not stop his burning desires, so when the other newly departed souls left this plane of existence and moved to the beyond, he stayed. There were more bodies than the one he had left, and now he could have his pick of them.

He knew now that he had been overly ambitious. He had grown his former body to immobility, and he knew that his fat and lifestyle had led to his death. The enormity he had achieved in life was too great a goal, but the joy of growth, the mixed shame of growing too big for clothes, the feeling of fat swaying on his body as he made love, that was all still obtainable.

He chose for his target one of his former lovers. The man, Matt, had been particularly dedicated to fattening his former body. After the death of his gainer, Matt had moved back in with an old boyfriend. Matt was in his early 30s, with a solid, muscled build. Dark haired and dark eyed, Matt was a handsome man. As a feeder, Matt carried a little extra fat on his body from sampling his own cooking, but he was also a regular at the gym, and never missed a workout to burn off the calories his cooking brought with it. The spirit of gluttony had always wanted to see Matt bigger, but Matt had never let himself gain. Approaching the man, the spirit tried to enter Matt's body. He felt the body around him like an ill-fitting garment, he saw through Matt's eyes, and felt the man's soul - and was rejected from the body. The spirit found himself outside the body again, cut off from Matt's life source. Matt seemed visibly shaken - he looked around him, and a chill ran through his body.

The spirit was frustrated. Matt had loved him - why was it that he couldn't take root in this body? Peeking into Matt's body, but not attempting to take control - the spirit realized the reason he couldn't possess Matt - their natures were too different. Matt loved fat, loved seeing his partner blow up with fat, loved having sex with a man bigger than himself, but didn't want to grow fat. That could change.

The spirit took his time, whispering to Matt. He whispered about the love of growing fat, the power of the increased size, how arousing it was to be so massive. Results were slow - Matt loved his firm and muscled physique, but the spirit's whispers took their toll. The man noticed himself eating more, promising that he would work it off later. The promised gym workouts became less frequent, and the man noticed his clothes getting tighter as he packed on a few extra pounds. Matt's dick got hard as he realized how fat he had gotten. He was ready.

The spirit slid into place inside Matt's body. The body still didn't fit the spirit, so he decided to do something about that. Pushing with his ghostly powers, Matt's body swelled outward. His stomach blossomed out with fat, pooching in front of him, and going from a tiny overhang to something like a beach ball hanging on the front of Matt's body. Thick pectorals hung low over the ball belly, and hair spread over Matt's body. The spirit wasn't sure if his own body had been hairy, or if this man had kept himself shaved and the spirit's nature brought it out, regardless, the spirit was pleased with the results. Matt's dick grew hard and hot in the fat pad, and the spirit eagerly beat it off, enjoying the euphoric release for the first time since death.

Where Matt might have panicked otherwise, the spirit suppressed his fear. This was good. This felt good - this is natural, and Matt accepted the changes wrought upon his body. Matt's boyfriend was not oblivious to the changes. When he saw Matt, he demanded to know what the fuck had happened to him. The spirit led Matt's body to pin him down, and aggressively fucked the man. The spirit leaked the tiniest fragment of his essence into the man, and caused him to accept the changes. He begged Matt/the spirit for more, and the spirit was happy to oblige.

The spirit wore Matt for some time, stretching the body to where it felt comfortable, and wearing it long enough to ensure that the changes wrought in the body stayed permanent. Matt was there all along, in the brain with the spirit. He never even realized the spirit was there - the spirit of gluttony pressing his thoughts and sensations onto the man's mind to where he thought all the growth was his own idea. The sex was good too. When Matt's boyfriend decided that Matt had changed too much and dumped him, the spirit nudged him to another man who would be more supportive and encouraging of the changes taking place.

Content with how things were going, the spirit tried to make one more change - stop Matt from going to the gym. Throughout all the changes the spirit had wrought, Matt had clung tenaciously to the gym. The spirit was eager to see what kind of progress he could make on the body if Matt stopped burning the extra calories with his workouts. As he put the thought to Matt's mind, the spirit found himself rejected from Matt's body.

There were limits, then… Push a body too far, and he would be pushed out. The spirit admired his handiwork from outside Matt's body. The Man was a real muscle bull now. Thickly muscled arms coupled with a thick tank of a belly. The spirit of gluttony was pleased with his work on the man. Matt himself seemed confused, like he had awoken from a dream. He looked down on his body like he had never seen it before, with growing horror at the changes wrought in him. The spirit laughed within himself, and decided it was time to move on.
