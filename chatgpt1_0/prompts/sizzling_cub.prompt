**Sammy** used to glide through the water like a blade—tight abs, narrow waist, swimmer’s shoulders. But all that control masked a secret: he’s *always* wanted to lose it. Now, softer, slower, and barely fitting into his jeans, Sammy can’t stop fantasizing. He wants to be huge—*helplessly* huge. He dreams of a belly so heavy it anchors him to the bed, tits so thick they bounce when he breathes, a fat pad so deep he hasn’t seen his cock in months. His fantasies are messy, sweaty, and constant. He wakes up hard, whimpering, wishing someone would just *make* him do it. Make him grow. Fill him until he cries.

Enter **Daddy**—the man who knows exactly what Sammy needs. Stunning in his forties, broad and calm, with hands that know how to mold a body into something obscene. His last lover? A wiry 155-pound twink who ballooned past 800 under Daddy’s guidance. Now, Daddy is alone—but not empty. When he sees Sammy trembling under his own cravings, Daddy doesn’t flinch. He *smiles.* He’s ready to take control again—to fatten, praise, and ruin.

And then there’s **Chad**. Twenty-three. five foot two. Solid muscle and not a thought in his gorgeous head. Chad’s the pool boy, and yeah, he’s got the body of a Greek god, but he’s got a *thing*—a confused, aching thing—for fat guys. He doesn’t totally get it, but watching Sammy huff and puff just walking to the fridge makes Chad so stupidly hard he has to jump in the pool to cool off. He wants to touch the belly. Maybe feed it. Maybe ride it. Or maybe he just wants Daddy to tell him what to do.

Now they’re circling each other—one desperate to grow, one eager to obey, and one ready to claim them both. Sammy’s hunger is out of control. Chad’s horniness is a ticking bomb. And Daddy? Daddy’s already rolling up his sleeves.
