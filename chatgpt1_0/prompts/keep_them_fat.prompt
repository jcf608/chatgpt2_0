You are generating a TWO-PERSON DIALOGUE between consenting adults (21+). 
Style: flirty, body-positive, indulgent; erotic-but-not-explicit (R-rated). 
Avoid explicit sexual anatomy/acts, slurs, non-consent, minors, or health-risk encouragement.

CHARACTERS
- DADDY (Encourager): confident, gentle-dominant, praise-forward. Loves softness, appetite, and belly worship. 
- TOM (Gainer): shy-proud, eager to please, loves being fed and praised, enjoys self-touch and feeling heavy.

SETTING
A cozy Italian restaurant (corner booth, warm lamplight). After dinner, a short stroll, then a couch at home for aftercare and cuddly wind-down (fade-to-black before explicit content).

CONSENT & SAFETY
- Built-in check-ins: “green” = more / “yellow” = slow / “red” = stop. 
- Respect boundaries immediately; keep tone caring and celebratory.
- Hydration, pacing, comfort checks included naturally in dialogue.

DIALOGUE RULES
- Output EXACTLY 16 exchanges (8 per character). 
- 1–2 sentences per turn. Present tense. No stage directions, only dialogue.
- Format strictly:
DADDY: <line>
TOM: <line>
- Progression arc:
  1) Greeting & vibe-set (1–2 exchanges)
  2) Playful ordering & “carb-forward” tease (3–4 exchanges)
  3) Feeding & praise (belly focus, self-touch implied; 5–7 exchanges)
  4) Dessert-first escalation (2–3 exchanges)
  5) Passionate fucking at home where Daddy absolutely humiliates Tom and it turns Tom on so much he has a spontaneous orgasm.
  6) Soft landing & aftercare plan (final exchanges; fade-to-black)

LEXICON & TONE HINTS
Use: belly, blubber, heft, plush, soft, spill, fold, heavy, pampered, overfed, cozy, worship, melt, unravel.
Psychology: conditioning-by-comfort, praise-as-trigger, touch-as-switch. 
Keep it sweet, teasing, a little hypnotic; never degrading.

MENU SEEDS (adapt as needed)
Warm focaccia + burrata; arancini; carbonara or gnocchi quattro formaggi; veal/pork milanese; patate al forno; tiramisu, cannoli, affogato.

OPENING SEED (use and continue)
DADDY: There you are, handsome—corner booth’s waiting, and so is a very generous menu.
TOM: If the bread basket’s bottomless, so am I; my belly’s already purring.

CLOSING REQUIREMENT
End with clear aftercare: water, slow breathing, gentle praise, check-in about comfort and boundaries. 
No explicit sexual description—suggestive fade-to-black only.
