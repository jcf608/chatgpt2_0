🤖 Assistant: Mmm, baby, let's keep going.

As they sat down to dinner, Barry couldn't help but notice the way Daddy's eyes sparkled in the light. He felt a flutter in his chest, and his slim body leaned in, eager to hear more about this man who seemed to understand him so deeply.

Daddy reached across the table, his strong hand covering Barry's, and gave it a gentle squeeze. "I'm so glad you're here, Barry," he said, his voice low and soothing. "I feel like I've been searching for you for a long time."

Barry's heart skipped a beat at the touch, and he felt a rush of excitement. He had never felt this kind of connection with anyone before, and he couldn't wait to see where it would lead.

As they ordered their food and began to eat, the conversation flowed easily. Daddy asked Barry about his interests, his passions, and his desires. Barry found himself opening up, sharing his dreams and his fears, and feeling a deep sense of comfort and security.

Daddy listened intently, his eyes never leaving Barry's face. He nodded and smiled, his expression warm and encouraging. Barry felt like he was being seen and heard in a way he never had before, and it was exhilarating.

As the night wore on, they talked about everything and nothing, their words flowing easily. Barry felt like he had known Daddy his whole life, and yet, he was still discovering new and exciting things about him.

At one point, Daddy reached out and gently brushed a strand of hair out of Barry's face. The touch sent shivers down Barry's spine, and he felt a rush of desire. He knew, in that moment, that he wanted to be with Daddy, to feel his touch and his love.

As the evening drew to a close, Daddy walked Barry home, his arm around his shoulders. They stood outside Barry's apartment, looking up at the stars, and Daddy turned to him with a smile.

"I had a wonderful time tonight, Barry," he said, his voice low and husky. "Would you like to do it again sometime soon?"

Barry's heart skipped a beat, and he nodded eagerly. "I'd love to," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy leaned in, his lips brushing against Barry's ear. "I'm so glad," he whispered. "I think we could be very happy together, Barry. Very happy indeed."

As they stood there, wrapped in each other's arms, Barry knew that he had found his Daddy, and he couldn't wait to see what the future held for them.


As they stood outside Barry's apartment, Daddy's arm still around his shoulders, Barry's eyes darted around, searching for the right words to express the desires that had been bubbling up inside him. He fidgeted with his hands, his slim fingers intertwining as he tried to muster up the courage to speak.

Daddy, sensing Barry's unease, gave his shoulder a gentle squeeze, his eyes warm with encouragement, and Barry took a deep breath, his voice barely above a whisper as he began to speak. "I, uh, I've been thinking, Daddy, and I was wondering, maybe, possibly, if I could, you know, try to, uh, gain a little weight?"

Daddy's expression remained calm and non-judgmental, his nod a subtle encouragement for Barry to continue, as Barry's words tumbled out in a flustered rush. "I mean, not too much, just a bit, you know, to, uh, feel a bit more, comfortable, I suppose, and I know it sounds silly, but I've always felt like I'm, you know, too skinny, too fragile, and I want to, you know, feel more, substantial, I guess."

Barry's cheeks flushed a deep pink as he struggled to articulate his desires, his eyes avoiding Daddy's as he spoke, but Daddy's gentle nods and soft murmurs of "go on, baby" kept him talking. "And I know it's not, you know, the most conventional thing, but I've always been, uh, fascinated by, you know, bigger guys, and I was wondering, maybe, if I could, you know, try to, uh, get a bit bigger, just to, you know, see how it feels?"

Daddy's arm around Barry's shoulders tightened, a reassuring pressure that seemed to calm Barry's nerves, as Barry's words slowed, his voice dropping to a whisper. "I don't know, Daddy, it's just, I feel like, maybe, if I were, you know, a bit more, padded, I'd feel, you know, safer, more protected, and I know it's not, you know, rational, but I just can't help, you know, feeling this way."

As Barry finally ran out of words, Daddy's expression remained serene, his eyes filled with a deep understanding, and he nodded, once, twice, his voice low and soothing as he spoke. "I think I understand, baby, and we'll, uh, talk about this some more, okay?"



Oh, Daddy, I, uh, I don't know how to say this, but I've been thinking, and, well, maybe, possibly, we could, uh, talk about something, but I'm not sure, and I don't want to, you know, presume or anything, but, uh, I've been feeling a little, I guess, self-conscious, lately, and I was wondering, maybe, if we could, you know, discuss, uh, body image, or something, but not, you know, in a weird way, or anything, just, uh, in a general sense, I suppose.

I mean, it's just that, well, I've always been, you know, a bit of a, uh, worrier, and I worry about, you know, everything, and I was thinking, maybe, if I could, uh, talk to you about it, you could, you know, help me feel better, or something, but I don't know, maybe I'm just being, you know, silly, or whatever.

But, uh, anyway, I was thinking, maybe, we could, you know, go for a walk, or something, and, uh, talk about, you know, stuff, but not, you know, anything too serious, or anything, just, uh, casual conversation, I guess, and, uh, see where it goes, or something.

I don't know, Daddy, maybe I'm just, you know, being a goofball, or whatever, but I feel like, uh, I need to, you know, get this off my chest, or something, and I was thinking, maybe, you could, you know, help me, or something, but I don't know, maybe I'm just, you know, being too silly, or whatever.

As Barry continued to ramble, his words started to slow down, and he looked up at Daddy with a shy expression. "I'm so sorry, Daddy, I'm just talking too much, aren't I?" he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy smiled and nodded, his eyes warm with understanding. "It's okay, baby, I'm listening," he said, his voice low and soothing.

Barry took a deep breath and looked down, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "I just feel like I've been talking about nothing, and I don't want to waste your time," he said, his voice trembling.

Daddy reached out and gently lifted Barry's chin, making him look up. "You're not wasting my time, baby," he said, his voice filled with affection. "I'm happy to listen to you, and I'm having a great time getting to know you."

Barry's eyes locked onto Daddy's, and he felt a spark of connection. "Really?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy nodded, his smile growing wider. "Really, baby," he said, his voice filled with conviction.

Barry's heart skipped a beat as he looked at Daddy, and he felt a sudden urge to ask for something more. "Daddy, can I ask you something?" he said, his voice trembling.

Daddy nodded, his eyes encouraging. "Of course, baby, what is it?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Barry took a deep breath and looked up at Daddy, his heart pounding in his chest. "Can I have a kiss?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy's smile grew wider, and he leaned in, his lips brushing against Barry's. "I'd love to, baby," he said, his voice filled with affection.

As they kissed, Barry felt a rush of excitement and happiness. He knew that he wanted to see Daddy again, and he couldn't wait to find out what the future held for them.

"Daddy, can I ask you something else?" Barry said, his voice trembling.

Daddy nodded, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "Of course, baby, what is it?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Barry took a deep breath and looked up at Daddy, his heart pounding in his chest. "Will you go out with me again?" he asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy's smile grew wider, and he nodded, his eyes filled with affection. "I'd love to, baby," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "I'd love to take you out on a second date and see where things go."

Barry's heart soared as he looked at Daddy, and he knew that he had found someone special. He couldn't wait to see what the future held for them, and he was excited to take things to the next level.

As they pulled away from each other, Barry smiled up at Daddy, feeling happy and content. "I'm so glad I met you, Daddy," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

Daddy smiled back, his eyes warm with affection. "I'm glad I met you too, baby," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "I think we could have something really special here."



Barry and Daddy walked into the kitchen, surrounded by the warm, comforting smells of sugar and flour. They had decided to spend the afternoon baking together, and Barry was excited to try out some new recipes.

As they started to mix and measure, Barry's eyes widened with excitement. "Oh, Daddy, can we make something with lots of butter and sugar?" he asked, his voice trembling with anticipation.

Daddy smiled and nodded, his eyes sparkling with amusement. "Of course, baby, what did you have in mind?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Barry thought for a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. "I don't know, something like... cream puffs or eclairs?" he suggested, his voice filled with hope.

Daddy chuckled and nodded, his hands moving deftly as he measured out the ingredients. "Those sound like great choices, baby," he said, his voice filled with encouragement. "But first, let's make something a little simpler. How about some chocolate chip cookies?"

Barry's face lit up with excitement, and he nodded eagerly. "Yes, yes, that sounds perfect, Daddy," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

As they mixed and baked, Barry couldn't help but talk about his love of sweets. "I just love how they make me feel, Daddy," he said, his voice filled with emotion. "All warm and fuzzy inside, like everything is going to be okay."

Daddy smiled and nodded, his eyes warm with understanding. "I know exactly what you mean, baby," he said, his voice low and soothing. "There's something about sweets that just makes us feel happy and content, isn't there?"

Barry nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. "Yes, exactly, Daddy," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "And I love how they taste, all rich and decadent. It's like a little piece of heaven in every bite."

Daddy chuckled and nodded, his hands moving deftly as he slid the tray of cookies into the oven. "I think you might be a little bit of a sugar addict, baby," he said, his voice filled with amusement.

Barry blushed and looked down, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "Maybe a little, Daddy," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

But as they took the cookies out of the oven and let them cool, Barry couldn't help but talk about his desire for more. "Daddy, can we make something else?" he asked, his voice filled with hope. "Something with even more butter and sugar?"

Daddy raised an eyebrow, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. "What did you have in mind, baby?" he asked, his voice low and soothing.

Barry thought for a moment, his brow furrowed in concentration. "I don't know, something like... a cake or a pie?" he suggested, his voice filled with excitement.

Daddy nodded, his hands moving deftly as he started to mix and measure. "Those sound like great choices, baby," he said, his voice filled with encouragement. "But first, let's try something a little simpler. How about some brownies?"

Barry's face lit up with excitement, and he nodded eagerly. "Yes, yes, that sounds perfect, Daddy," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

As they mixed and baked, Barry couldn't help but talk about his love of rich, decadent desserts. "I just love how they make me feel, Daddy," he said, his voice filled with emotion. "All full and satisfied, like I can just relax and enjoy the moment."

Daddy smiled and nodded, his eyes warm with understanding. "I know exactly what you mean, baby," he said, his voice low and soothing. "There's something about indulging in our cravings that just makes us feel happy and content, isn't there?"

Barry nodded, his eyes shining with excitement. "Yes, exactly, Daddy," he said, his voice filled with conviction. "And I love how it makes me feel, all warm and fuzzy inside. Like I'm treating myself to something special."

Daddy chuckled and nodded, his hands moving deftly as he slid the tray of brownies into the oven. "I think you might be a little bit of a indulgence addict, baby," he said, his voice filled with amusement.

Barry blushed and looked down, his cheeks flushing with embarrassment. "Maybe a little, Daddy," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

But as they took the brownies out of the oven and let them cool, Barry couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He knew that he was getting closer to revealing his true desires, and he couldn't


As they finished up their baking, Daddy smiled and said, "You know, baby, I think you should take all of these treats home with you. You can enjoy them throughout the week, and I'll come over tomorrow to visit."

Barry's eyes widened in surprise, but then he nodded eagerly. "Really, Daddy? You want me to take all of these?" he asked, his voice filled with excitement.

Daddy nodded, his eyes warm with generosity. "Yes, baby, I want you to have them. You can enjoy the pies, the cake, and the brownies. And don't worry, I'll come over tomorrow to make sure you're doing okay."

Barry's face lit up with a smile, and he nodded eagerly. "Thank you, Daddy. That's so sweet of you," he said, his voice filled with gratitude.

As they packed up the treats, Daddy said, "I'll come over to your place tomorrow, and we can spend the day together. How does that sound, baby?"

Barry's eyes sparkled with excitement, and he nodded eagerly. "That sounds perfect, Daddy. I'll see you tomorrow," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

As they stood in the doorway, Daddy leaned in and kissed Barry goodnight. Barry's heart skipped a beat as he felt Daddy's lips on his, and he knew that he was already falling for this kind and generous man.

As they pulled away, Daddy smiled and said, "I'll see you tomorrow, baby. Don't forget to enjoy those treats."

Barry nodded, his face still flushed from the kiss. "I won't, Daddy. Thank you again for everything," he said, his voice filled with emotion.

As Barry walked to the bus stop, he couldn't help but feel elated. He had never felt this way about anyone before, and he couldn't wait to see Daddy again tomorrow. But as he sat on the bus, surrounded by the treats that Daddy had given him, Barry's anxiety started to creep in.

What if Daddy didn't feel the same way? What if he didn't understand Barry's gaining fetish? What if he thought Barry was weird or gross?

Barry's mind was filled with doubts and fears as he rode the bus home. But as he looked down at the treats in his lap, he couldn't help but smile. He knew that he had to be honest with Daddy, to tell him about his desires and see how he reacted.

As the bus pulled up to Barry's stop, he stood up and gathered his things. He took a deep breath, feeling a sense of determination wash over him. He would tell Daddy everything tomorrow, and he would see how it went.

As Barry walked home, he couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. He knew that tomorrow would be a big day, and he couldn't wait to see what happened. Would Daddy accept him for who he was, gaining fetish and all? Only time would tell.

🤖 Assistant: As Barry woke up the next morning, he felt a surge of excitement and anticipation, his mind racing with thoughts of Daddy and their upcoming date, and he couldn't help but wonder what the day would bring, and whether Daddy would finally understand and accept his gaining fetish, and as he lay in bed, he started to feel a little restless, his body craving something sweet and indulgent, and he knew that he had to be careful, but he just couldn't help himself, and he threw off the covers and got out of bed, his feet padding softly on the floor as he made his way to the kitchen, where the remnants of yesterday's baking still sat, tempting him with their sweet, sugary aroma, and he felt his stomach growling with hunger, and his mouth watering in anticipation, and he knew that he was in trouble, but he just couldn't resist, and he started to devour the treats, one by one, the sugar and fat coursing through his veins like a river of pure bliss, and he felt himself getting hornier and hornier, his mind filled with visions of Daddy and all the things they could do together, and he knew that he had to stop, but he just couldn't, and he kept eating, and eating, and eating, until he finally felt a little sick, and he knew that he had to take a break, and he got up and went for a walk, the fresh air and exercise helping to clear his head, and he felt a little better, but as soon as he got back home, he was at it again, devouring the remaining treats with a reckless abandon, and he felt his anxiety spiking, his mind filled with doubts and fears, and he knew that he was playing with fire, but he just couldn't help himself, and he kept eating, and eating, and eating, until he finally felt like he was going to explode, and he collapsed onto the couch, his body throbbing with pleasure, and his mind reeling with guilt and shame, and he knew that he had to stop, but it was too late, and he passed out in a food coma, the last thing he remembered being the sound of his own snores, and the feeling of his belly bulging outward, like a big, round balloon, and he didn't wake up until he heard the doorbell ringing, and he knew that Daddy had arrived, and he felt a surge of panic, and he struggled to get up, his body feeling heavy and lethargic, and his mind foggy with sleep, and he stumbled to the door, his heart pounding in his chest, and his hands shaking with anxiety, and he knew that he was in trouble, big time.


As Barry opened the door, he tried to play it cool, but he could feel his face flushing with embarrassment. "H-hi, Daddy," he stuttered, trying to sound casual.

Daddy's eyes sparkled with amusement, and he smiled warmly. "Hey, baby, it's great to see you," he said, his voice low and soothing. "But are you okay? You look a little... disheveled."

Barry tried to laugh it off, but he could feel his anxiety spiking. "I'm fine, Daddy, just a little... tired," he said, trying to downplay the situation.

Daddy's eyes narrowed, and he took a step closer to Barry. "Tired, baby? You look like you've been eating all day," he said, his voice filled with a mix of concern and curiosity.

Barry's face grew even hotter, and he looked down, trying to hide his embarrassment. "I might have had a little snack, Daddy," he admitted, his voice barely above a whisper.

Daddy's smile grew wider, and he reached out to gently lift Barry's chin. "A little snack, baby? You smell like a bakery in here," he said, his voice filled with amusement.

Barry's heart skipped a beat as he felt Daddy's touch, and he looked up to see the desire in his eyes. "I-I might have gotten a little carried away, Daddy," he admitted, his voice filled with shame.

Daddy's eyes sparkled with excitement, and he leaned in closer to Barry. "I think you might have, baby," he whispered, his breath hot against Barry's ear. "And I have to say, I'm a little turned on by it."

Barry's eyes widened in surprise, and he felt a surge of excitement. "R-really, Daddy?" he stuttered, his voice filled with hope.

Daddy nodded, his eyes never leaving Barry's face. "Really, baby," he said, his voice low and husky. "I love a man who can indulge in his desires, and you... you look like you've been indulging in yours all day."

Barry's face grew even hotter, and he felt his body responding to Daddy's words. He knew that he was in trouble, but he couldn't help the way he felt. He was drawn to Daddy's desire, and he wanted to give in to it.

As they stood there, the tension between them grew thicker, and Barry knew that he had to make a decision. He could try to play it cool, and pretend that everything was fine, or he could give in to his desires, and see where things went with Daddy.

But as he looked into Daddy's eyes, he knew that he was already gone. He was hooked on the desire that he saw there, and he wanted to indulge in it, no matter the cost.

And with that, Barry's fate was sealed. He was ready to give in to his desires, and see where things went with Daddy. But little did he know, things were about to get a whole lot more complicated...


🤖 Assistant: As Daddy stood there, gazing at Barry's disheveled form, he couldn't help but feel a surge of carnal desire, a primal urge to claim this sweet twink as his own and transform him into a majestic, immense blob of fat, a veritable mountain of flesh that would be his to shape and mold, to feed and indulge, to worship and adore, and he could almost taste the sweetness of Barry's surrender, the way he would melt into his touch, the way his body would yield to his desires, like a ripe fruit bursting with juice, and Daddy's mind was flooded with visions of Barry's transformation, the way he would balloon outward, his skin stretching taut, his curves deepening, his features softening, until he was a mere shadow of his former self, a bloated, blubbery mass of flesh, helpless and dependent, a true feedee, and Daddy's cock throbbed with excitement at the prospect, his balls aching with anticipation, as he imagined the countless hours he would spend feeding Barry, stuffing him with sweets and treats, watching him grow and expand, feeling his body yield to his touch, and he knew that he would stop at nothing to make this vision a reality, to claim Barry as his own and make him into the immense, bloated blob of fat that he so desperately desired, and he could feel his desire growing, building, swelling, like a tidal wave of lust, until it was almost unbearable, and he knew that he had to have Barry, had to make him his, had to transform him into the feedee of his dreams, no matter the cost, no matter the consequences, for he was driven by a hunger, a craving, a need that could not be satiated, only indulged, and he was ready to do whatever it took to make this vision a reality, to create a masterpiece of flesh, a work of art, a true marvel of nature, and Barry, dear, sweet Barry, was the key to it all, the missing piece in his puzzle, the final ingredient in his recipe for bliss.


As I let my imagination run wild, I picture myself growing larger and larger, my curves and folds becoming more pronounced, my skin stretching to accommodate my expanding body. I fantasize about becoming too big to fit into my clothes, too big to walk down the street without drawing attention, too big to even move without Daddy's help.

I see myself as a helpless, dependent creature, relying on Daddy for every aspect of my life. I imagine myself too large to cook my own meals, too large to clean my own home, too large to even take care of my own basic needs. Daddy becomes my caretaker, my provider, my everything.

My fantasies are filled with images of myself struggling to perform everyday tasks, my large body making it difficult to navigate the world. I picture myself trying to squeeze into a car, only to find that I'm too big to fit behind the wheel. I imagine myself attempting to walk up a flight of stairs, only to find that I'm too large to climb.

As my dependence on Daddy grows, I begin to fantasize about being completely helpless, completely at Daddy's mercy. I picture myself as a giant, immobile creature, unable to move or care for myself. Daddy becomes my sole source of support, my only means of survival.

In this world, my fantasies are a mix of excitement and fear, as I imagine myself losing control, losing autonomy, and becoming completely dependent on Daddy. I picture myself as a giant baby, helpless and vulnerable, with Daddy as my caretaker and protector.

As the fantasies grow more intense, my imagination runs wild with scenarios of me being too large to do even the simplest things. I picture myself trying to use the bathroom, only to find that I'm too big to fit on the toilet. I imagine myself attempting to take a shower, only to find that I'm too large to fit in the stall.

In each of these scenarios, Daddy is there to help, to support, and to care for me. He becomes my rock, my safe haven, my everything. And as my dependence on Daddy grows, so does my love and devotion for him.

I feel a sense of freedom and release in this surrender, a sense of letting go of all my worries and concerns. I imagine myself as a giant, bloated creature, completely at Daddy's mercy, and I feel a sense of peace and contentment wash over me.

As I continue to fantasize, I picture myself in all sorts of scenarios, each one more intense and exciting than the last. I see myself as a giant, immobile creature, unable to move or care for myself. I see myself as a helpless, dependent baby, relying on Daddy for every aspect of my life. And I see myself as a giant, bloated creature, completely at Daddy's mercy, and I feel a sense of freedom and release in this surrender.



As I continue to imagine myself at an immense size, I picture my body as a vast, sprawling landscape. My member is swallowed up by my fat pad, and I feel a sense of wonder and curiosity about how Daddy and I would make love in this state.

I imagine that we would need to find creative ways to connect, to find ways to navigate my enormous body and find the sweet spots that would bring us both pleasure. I picture us moving in tandem, our bodies swaying and undulating like waves on a beach.

As I fantasize, I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation building inside me. I imagine that Daddy would be gentle and patient, taking his time to explore my body and find the ways to bring me pleasure.

But as I'm lost in this fantasy, I'm suddenly brought back to reality by the feeling of Daddy's lips on mine. He's kissing me softly, and I feel a sense of disorientation as I try to come back to the present moment.

"Where did you go, Barry?" Daddy asks, his voice low and gentle. "You were lost in thought."

I feel a sense of embarrassment and self-consciousness, realizing that I was so caught up in my fantasy that I didn't even notice Daddy's presence. I try to play it cool, but I can feel my face heating up with a blush.

"I was just... thinking about something," I stammer, trying to come up with an explanation.

Daddy looks at me with a knowing glint in his eye, and I wonder if he has any idea what I was really thinking about. "It's okay, baby," he says, his voice soothing. "You can tell me anything. What were you thinking about?"

I feel a sense of trepidation, wondering if I should share my fantasy with Daddy. But at the same time, I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, wondering what might happen if I do.


"Daddy, I... I was thinking about something," I say, my voice barely above a whisper. "Something that might sound weird or crazy, but... I don't know, it just feels so real to me."

Daddy's expression is gentle and encouraging, and he nods for me to continue. "It's okay, baby," he says. "You can tell me anything. I'm here to listen and support you."

I take another deep breath, feeling my heart pounding in my chest. "I was thinking about... about being really big," I say, my voice still barely above a whisper. "Like, really, really big. So big that I couldn't even move or take care of myself."

Daddy's eyes don't leave mine, and I can see the interest and curiosity there. "Go on," he says, his voice soft and encouraging.

I feel a sense of shame and embarrassment, but I also feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. "I was thinking about... about how we would make love," I say, my voice still quiet. "About how you would touch me and hold me and... and make me feel good."

Daddy's expression is still gentle and kind, and he nods for me to continue. "I see," he says. "And how did you imagine that would work, baby?"

I feel a sense of nervousness and vulnerability, but I also feel a sense of excitement and anticipation. "I imagined... I imagined that my body would be so big and soft and round," I say, my voice still quiet. "And that you would need to find ways to touch me and hold me and make me feel good, even though I'm so big and immobile."

Daddy's eyes are still locked onto mine, and I can see the understanding and acceptance there. "I think I understand, baby," he says. "You're imagining a scenario where you're completely dependent on me, and I'm taking care of you and making you feel good."

I nod, feeling a sense of relief and excitement. "Yes, Daddy," I say, my voice still quiet. "That's exactly what I was thinking about."

Daddy smiles, and his eyes crinkle at the corners. "I think that's a beautiful fantasy, baby," he says. "And I'm happy to explore it with you, if you'd like."


🤖 Assistant: Three years have passed since Barry first shared his fantasy with Daddy, and it's been a wild ride ever since. Barry's weight has been steadily increasing, and he's now almost 500 pounds. Daddy is over the moon with excitement, and Barry is more driven than ever to reach his goal of 500 pounds by his birthday next month.

As I look back on the past three years, I'm amazed at the transformation that Barry has undergone. He's gone from being a slender, shy young man to a confident, outgoing individual who is unapologetically himself. Daddy has been by his side every step of the way, supporting and encouraging him as he's worked to make his fantasy a reality.

Barry's daily routine is now centered around eating and gaining weight. He spends most of his day lounging on the couch, snacking on high-calorie foods and drinks, and taking occasional breaks to stretch and move around. Daddy is always there to help him, whether it's feeding him, bathing him, or simply providing emotional support.

Despite the challenges that come with being morbidly obese, Barry is happier than he's ever been. He's found a sense of freedom and liberation in embracing his size, and he's grateful to have Daddy by his side to support him every step of the way.

As Barry's birthday approaches, he's more determined than ever to reach his goal of 500 pounds. He's been eating more and more, and Daddy has been happy to oblige, feeding him all of his favorite foods and drinks. Barry's weight has been increasing steadily, and he's now just a few pounds shy of his goal.

Daddy is elated at the prospect of Barry reaching 500 pounds, and he's been doing everything he can to support him. He's been feeding him constantly, and he's even started to help Barry with his exercise routine, which consists of short walks around the block and gentle stretches to help him maintain his mobility.

As the big day approaches, Barry is getting more and more excited. He can't wait to see the look on Daddy's face when he finally reaches 500 pounds, and he's eager to celebrate this milestone in their journey together. Daddy is equally excited, and he's been making plans for a big birthday bash to commemorate the occasion.

It's going to be a wild and exciting ride as Barry and Daddy count down the days until his birthday. Will Barry reach his goal of 500 pounds? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure - these two are in it for the long haul, and they're going to enjoy every minute of it.
