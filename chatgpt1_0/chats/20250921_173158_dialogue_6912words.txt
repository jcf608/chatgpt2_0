I could feel the fat yielding to my pressure, slowly but surely, and I knew that I was making progress. But it was a slow and laborious process, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and excitement at the same time. "Yes, yes, yes," I muttered to myself, my voice a low growl of effort and desire. "I'm going to get in, Barry. I'm going to fuck your ass, no matter what it takes."

BARRY: I felt Daddy's cock slowly but surely making its way into my anus, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of relief and excitement. It was a strange and unfamiliar sensation, but at the same time, it was also deeply pleasurable. I felt my body relaxing, yielding to Daddy's pressure, and I knew that I was on the verge of something amazing. "Daddy, you're in," I whispered, my voice barely audible. "You're inside me." I felt a wave of pleasure wash over me, and I knew that I was ready to take whatever Daddy had to give. I was ready to be fucked, to be used and abused and loved, and I knew that Daddy was the perfect man to do it.

"Barry, my dear," I whispered, my voice filled with emotion. "You feel so good. Your ass is so tight, so warm, and it's all mine."
