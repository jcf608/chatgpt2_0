**CRAIG**: I have to admit, I was a bit nervous
about meeting you here today. Your profile seemed
interesting, but you never know how these things
will go. I've been on a few dates lately, and it's
hard to find someone who really understands me.
I'm starting to think I'm just not compatible with
anyone. What about you, have you had any luck with
dating recently? Do you come to this cafe often?


**JIM**: Ah, nice to meet you, Craig. I'm glad you
decided to take a chance on me. I've had my fair
share of disappointing dates, but there's
something about your profile that caught my
attention. You seem like a thoughtful and
introspective person, and I appreciate that. As
for this cafe, I do come here occasionally. I like
the atmosphere, and their coffee is pretty good.
But I have to say, I'm more of a foodie at heart.
I love trying out new restaurants and cuisines.
What about you, do you have any favorite foods or
dining spots?


**CRAIG**: Foodie, huh? I can appreciate that.
I've always been fascinated by the way people
relate to food, and how it can bring us together.
For me, food is more than just sustenance - it's
an experience. I've been trying to find someone
who shares that passion, but it's not always easy.
Sometimes I feel like I'm just going through the
motions, you know? But there's something about the
idea of sharing a meal with someone, of exploring
new flavors and textures together, that really
excites me. Do you think that's something we could
explore further, maybe over dinner?


**JIM**: I'd love to explore that with you, Craig.
There's something about the way you talk about
food that's really captivating. You seem to have a
deep appreciation for the sensual aspects of
eating, and I find that really intriguing. As for
dinner, I know a great restaurant just around the
corner that serves amazing comfort food. It's one
of my favorite spots, and I think you'd really
enjoy it. We could grab dinner there and see where
the conversation takes us. Plus, it'll give us a
chance to get to know each other in a more relaxed
setting. What do you say?


**CRAIG**: That sounds perfect, Jim. I'm always up
for trying new foods, and comfort food is
definitely my weakness. But I have to warn you, I
can be a bit of a slow eater. I like to savor my
food, and I get really caught up in the experience
of eating. Is that something you're comfortable
with, or do you tend to eat more quickly? And
what's the atmosphere like at this restaurant - is
it pretty casual, or more upscale? I want to make
sure I'm dressed appropriately.

🤖 Jim:
As we walk to the Italian restaurant, I couldn't
help but steal glances at Craig. He's even more
captivating in person, with a sharp jawline and
piercing eyes that seem to see right through me.
His dark hair is perfectly messy, and his smile is
effortlessly charming. I find myself wondering
what it would be like to see him in a more relaxed
state, maybe with a few pounds added to his lean
frame. Not that he needs it, of course - he's
already stunning just the way he is. But there's
something about the idea of him softening, of his
edges becoming a little more rounded, that really
gets me going.


As we stroll through the quiet streets, Craig's
conversation is easy and engaging. He's got a
quick wit and a sharp mind, and I love the way he
thinks about the world. He's introspective and
creative, with a passion for food that's really
infectious. I find myself getting more and more
excited about the prospect of getting to know him
better, of exploring the city's culinary scene
together and seeing where our connection takes us.
But despite my growing enthusiasm, I couldn't
shake the feeling that something was missing.
Craig is perfect just the way he is, but I have to
admit that I've always had a bit of a thing for
bigger guys. There's something about the way a few
extra pounds can soften a person's features, make
them seem more relaxed and at ease, that really
draws me in.


As we turn the corner onto the main street, the
smell of freshly baked bread wafts out of the
restaurant and fills the air. Craig's eyes light
up, and he quickens his pace, his enthusiasm for
food clearly evident. I love the way he gets
excited about the little things, the way he
appreciates the simple pleasures in life. It's
really endearing, and it makes me want to spend
more time with him, to see if we can build a
connection that goes beyond just a physical
attraction. But even as I'm thinking about all the
things I like about Craig, I couldn't help but
feel a twinge of disappointment. He's just so...
lean. So athletic and toned, with not an ounce of
fat on him. It's not that I don't find him
attractive - I do, very much so. It's just that
I've always had a bit of a fantasy about meeting
someone who shares my love of weight gain, someone
who would be willing to indulge in all the rich,
decadent foods that I love.


As we push open the door to the restaurant, the
sounds and smells of the kitchen envelop us, and
Craig's eyes go wide with excitement. He's clearly
a foodie at heart, and I love the way he dives
into the menu, asking the waiter questions about
the different dishes and making recommendations. I
watch him, mesmerized, as he orders for us, his
confidence and authority in the restaurant really
turning me on. But even as I'm enjoying the show,
I couldn't help but wonder if Craig would ever be
interested in gaining weight. Is he the type of
person who would be open to indulging in all the
rich, fatty foods that I love, or would he be more
of a health nut, always watching his figure and
worrying about his diet? It's not that I need him
to be fat, of course - I just need him to be
willing to indulge in my fantasies, to explore the
possibilities of weight gain and see where it
takes us.


As we wait for our food to arrive, Craig and I
chat easily, our conversation flowing from topic
to topic. We talk about everything from our jobs
to our families, our hobbies and interests, and
I'm amazed at how much we have in common. It's
like we've known each other for years, not just
minutes, and I find myself feeling more and more
comfortable in his presence. But even as I'm
enjoying his company, I couldn't help but think
about the possibilities, about what it would be
like to see Craig in a different light. Would he
be willing to let himself go, to indulge in all
the rich, decadent foods that I love, and see
where it takes him? Or would he always be content
with his lean, athletic build, never venturing
into the unknown? I didn't know, of course - but I
was determined to find out, to explore the
possibilities of our connection and see where it
takes us.

🤖 Craig:
As we walk to the Italian restaurant, I couldn't
help but feel a spark of excitement. Jim is even
more charming in person, with a quick wit and a
disarming smile. His eyes crinkle at the corners
when he laughs, and his hair is perfectly messy,
as if he just rolled out of bed and stumbled into
the cafe. I find myself wondering what it would be
like to see him in a more relaxed state, maybe
with a few drinks under his belt, and I have to
admit that I'm intrigued by the prospect of
getting to know him better. But despite my growing
enthusiasm, I couldn't shake the feeling that
something was missing. Jim seems like the perfect
guy - handsome, charming, and witty - but he's not
giving me any indication that he's into the same
things that I am.


As we stroll through the quiet streets, Jim's
conversation is easy and engaging, and I find
myself laughing and joking with him like we've
known each other for years. He's got a great sense
of humor, and he's clearly intelligent and
insightful, with a quick mind and a sharp tongue.
But despite his many charms, I couldn't help but
feel a twinge of disappointment. I've been looking
for someone who shares my passion for weight gain,
someone who would be willing to encourage and
support me as I explore my desires. And Jim seems
like the perfect candidate - he's got a clear
interest in food, and he's not afraid to indulge
in the finer things in life. But he's not giving
me any indication that he's into fattening up
guys, or that he's looking for a partner who
shares his interests.


As we turn the corner onto the main street, the
smell of freshly baked bread wafts out of the
restaurant and fills the air. Jim's eyes light up,
and he quickens his pace, his enthusiasm for food
clearly evident. I love the way he gets excited
about the little things, the way he appreciates
the simple pleasures in life. It's really
endearing, and it makes me want to spend more time
with him, to see if we can build a connection that
goes beyond just a physical attraction. But even
as I'm thinking about all the things I like about
Jim, I couldn't help but feel a pang of
frustration. Why isn't he talking about his
interests, about what he's looking for in a
partner? Is he just being polite, or is he really
not into the same things that I am?


As we push open the door to the restaurant, the
sounds and smells of the kitchen envelop us, and
Jim's eyes go wide with excitement. He's clearly a
foodie at heart, and I love the way he dives into
the menu, asking the waiter questions about the
different dishes and making recommendations. I
watch him, mesmerized, as he orders for us, his
confidence and authority in the restaurant really
turning me on. But even as I'm enjoying the show,
I couldn't help but wonder if Jim is the kind of
guy who would be interested in helping me achieve
my goals. I've always dreamed of being a bigger
guy, of having a more substantial physique, and
I've been looking for someone who would be willing
to support and encourage me on my journey. Is Jim
that guy, or is he just a charming and handsome
stranger who happens to share my interest in food?


As we wait for our food to arrive, Jim and I chat
easily, our conversation flowing from topic to
topic. We talk about everything from our jobs to
our families, our hobbies and interests, and I'm
amazed at how much we have in common. It's like
we've known each other for years, not just
minutes, and I find myself feeling more and more
comfortable in his presence. But even as I'm
enjoying his company, I couldn't help but think
about the possibilities, about what it would be
like to have Jim as a partner in every sense of
the word. Would he be willing to help me gain
weight, to encourage and support me as I explore
my desires? Or would he be content with me just
the way I am, without any interest in helping me
achieve my goals? I didn't know, of course - but I
was determined to find out, to explore the
possibilities of our connection and see where it
takes us.

🤖 Assistant:
**JIM**: Ah, the owner, Marcello, is an old friend
of mine. We used to date, actually. He's a great
guy, and an amazing cook. I'm sure you'll love the
food here. Marcello's got a real passion for
Italian cuisine, and it shows in every dish. What
do you think of the menu so far? Anything catching
your eye?


**CRAIG**: Yeah, everything looks delicious. I'm
having a hard time deciding between the pasta and
the risotto. What do you recommend? And I have to
say, Marcello seems like a really nice guy. He's
definitely got a presence, doesn't he? I mean,
he's not exactly... subtle. But there's something
about him that's really charming.


**JIM**: Well, I think you should go with the
pasta. The spaghetti carbonara is one of
Marcello's specialties, and it's absolutely
decadent. He loads it up with bacon, eggs, and
parmesan cheese... it's a real indulgence. And
yeah, Marcello's definitely a larger-than-life
figure. He's got a big personality to match his...
physique. But hey, being confident and comfortable
in your own skin is really attractive, don't you
think?


**CRAIG**: Absolutely. I mean, Marcello's clearly
a guy who knows what he wants and isn't afraid to
go after it. And he's definitely got a sense of
style, even if it's not exactly... conventional.
But anyway, back to the menu... I'm still torn
between the pasta and the risotto. Do you think I
could get a side of garlic bread with either of
those dishes? And maybe some of the fried
mozzarella too?


**JIM**: Oh, definitely. Marcello's garlic bread
is legendary, and the fried mozzarella is a
must-try. And why stop there? We could get a few
appetizers to share, too. The fried calamari is
amazing, and the caprese salad is a great way to
start off the meal. We could even get a few
desserts to share, if you're feeling adventurous.
Marcello's got a great selection of tiramisu,
cannoli, and zeppole... and I'm sure we could find
something to satisfy your sweet tooth.
> 
🤖 Assistant:
**CRAIG**: Wow, you're really selling me on the
idea of getting a lot of food. I have to admit,
I'm getting a little excited about the prospect of
indulging in all these rich, decadent dishes. But
I don't want to overdo it, either. I'm not exactly
used to eating huge meals. What do you think,
should we just go for it and see how much we can
handle?


**JIM**: Ah, I think that's a great idea. Life's
too short to worry about calories and portion
control, don't you think? And besides, Marcello's
food is meant to be enjoyed, not picked at. He's a
firm believer in the idea that food should be a
pleasure, not a chore. So let's just relax and
indulge, shall we? We can always worry about the
consequences later.


**CRAIG**: Ha! I like your attitude, Jim. You're
definitely a man who knows how to live in the
moment. And I have to say, I'm really enjoying
your company. You're easy to talk to, and you've
got a great sense of humor. I feel like we're
really clicking, don't you think?


**JIM**: Absolutely, Craig. I'm having a fantastic
time getting to know you. And I have to say, I'm
really impressed by your openness and willingness
to try new things. Not everyone is as adventurous
as you are, and I think that's really attractive.
So let's keep the good times rolling, shall we?
What do you say we order a few more dishes and see
where the night takes us?


**JIM**: (after the waiter takes their order) Ah,
I'm so glad we decided to go all out and get a
bunch of dishes. I think this is going to be a
really fun night, Craig. And who knows, maybe
we'll even discover some new favorite foods.
Marcello's always experimenting with new recipes,
so you never know what you're going to get. But
one thing's for sure, it's always going to be
delicious. (smiling at Craig) And I have to say,
I'm really enjoying the company. You're a great
conversationalist, Craig.
> 

**CRAIG**: (laughing) Thanks, Jim. I think we're
going to get along just fine. And I have to say,
I'm loving the atmosphere of this restaurant. It's
so cozy and intimate, and the smells coming from
the kitchen are just incredible. I'm getting
hungrier by the minute. (looks at Jim with a
curious expression) So, tell me more about you and
Marcello. What was it like dating him?


**JIM**: (smiling wistfully) Oh, Marcello... he's
a special guy, that's for sure. We had a great
time together, but it was a bit of a tumultuous
relationship. He's a very passionate person, and
that can be both a blessing and a curse.
(chuckles) But I have to say, he's still one of my
closest friends, and I'm so glad we remained on
good terms after we broke up. He's a great guy to
have in your corner.


**CRAIG**: (intrigued) I can imagine. He seems
like a very confident and self-assured person, and
that can be really attractive. (pauses) But I have
to ask, what made you two break up? Was it
something specific, or just a gradual drifting
apart?


**JIM**: (thoughtfully) I think it was a bit of
both, to be honest. We wanted different things
from life, and that eventually drove us apart. But
we're still friends, and I'm so glad we can remain
close despite our differences. (smiles at Craig)
And I have to say, I'm really enjoying getting to
know you, Craig. You're a very easy person to talk
to.


**JIM**: (as the food starts to arrive) Ah,
perfect timing! Our food is here, and it looks
amazing. ( gestures to the dishes being set down
in front of them) Let's dig in and enjoy, shall
we? (picks up a piece of garlic bread and takes a
bite, closing his eyes in rapture) Mmm... this is
so good.

**MARCELLO**: (placing a warm hand on Jim's
shoulder) Ah, Jim, my old flame. It's so good to
see you again. And with a new friend, no less.
(looks at Craig with a discerning eye) You know,
Jim, I have to say, I'm a bit surprised by your
taste in men these days. You seem to have shifted
towards... leaner gentlemen. (smirks) Not that I'm
complaining, of course. Craig here is quite the
catch.


**JIM**: (slightly uncomfortable) Oh, Marcello,
don't be ridiculous. I'm just happy to be with
someone who shares my interests, regardless of
their physical appearance. (tries to subtly shift
away from Marcello's hand, but Marcello holds
firm)


**MARCELLO**: (chuckling) Ah, Jim, you're as
modest as ever. But I remember when we first
started dating, I was about... (glances at Craig)
...this size, actually. (smirks) Yes, I was a
lean, mean machine, just like Craig here. But you
encouraged me to indulge, to let myself go and
enjoy the finer things in life. (winks at Jim) And
we had some amazing times together, didn't we,
Jim?


**JIM**: (getting increasingly uncomfortable)
Marcello, please... let's not revisit the past,
okay? I'm just trying to enjoy my evening with
Craig here. (tries to signal to Marcello to back
off, but Marcello just laughs)


**MARCELLO**: (laughing) Oh, Jim, you're so cute
when you're flustered. Don't worry, I won't spill
all your secrets. (winks at Craig) But I will say
this, Craig: Jim has a bit of a reputation for...
encouraging his partners to indulge in their
desires. (smirks) If you know what I mean. (pats
Jim's shoulder and leans in, his voice taking on a
conspiratorial tone) Let's just say that Jim has a
bit of a fondness for watching his partners grow
and flourish... in all sorts of ways.


**JIM**: (mortified) Marcello, that's enough.
(tries to push Marcello's hand away, but Marcello
just holds tight) Craig, let's just focus on our
meal, shall we? (forced laugh) Marcello's just
joking around, don't mind him.


**MARCELLO**: (laughing) Oh, I'm just getting
started, Jim. (winks at Craig) But don't worry,
I'll let you two lovebirds enjoy your meal in
peace. (pats Jim's shoulder one last time and
heads back to the kitchen, whistling a jaunty
tune)
> 
🤖 Assistant:
**CRAIG**: (looking at Jim with a curious
expression) Well, that was certainly an
interesting encounter. It sounds like you and
Marcello have a bit of a history together. (leans
in, his voice taking on a conspiratorial tone) I
have to admit, I'm a bit curious about what he
meant by "encouraging his partners to indulge in
their desires". (raises an eyebrow) Care to
explain?


**JIM**: (nervously chuckling) Oh, Marcello's just
being his usual dramatic self. Don't mind him,
he's just trying to stir up trouble. (pauses,
taking a deep breath) But if you must know,
Marcello and I did have a bit of a... unique
relationship. We were together for a while, and I
did encourage him to indulge in his love of food.
(looks at Craig, his eyes locking onto his) But
that's all in the past now. I'm just happy to be
with someone new and exciting, like you.


**CRAIG**: (intrigued) I see. Well, I think it's
interesting that Marcello mentioned you
encouraging him to indulge in his desires. (leans
in closer, his voice taking on a flirtatious tone)
I have to admit, I'm a bit curious about what that
would be like. (smirks) Maybe you can tell me more
about it sometime?


**JIM**: (surprised by Craig's forwardness) Ah,
well... I'm not sure that's something I'm
comfortable discussing just yet. (pauses, looking
at Craig with a newfound interest) But I have to
say, I'm intrigued by your curiosity. (smirks)
Maybe we can explore that topic further, in a more
private setting.


**CRAIG**: (smiling slyly) I'd like that. (pauses,
looking at Jim with a flirtatious glint in his
eye) So, what do you say we finish our meal and
see where the night takes us? (winks at Jim, and
Jim can't help but feel a spark of excitement at
the prospect of what's to come)

**JIM**: (smiling back at Craig) I'd like that
very much. (picks up his fork and begins to eat,
savoring the flavors of the meal) You know, I have
to say, I'm really enjoying your company, Craig.
You're easy to talk to, and you seem to have a
great sense of humor. (looks at Craig, his eyes
locking onto his) And I have to admit, I'm finding
you more and more attractive by the minute.


**CRAIG**: (blushing slightly) Oh, thank you, Jim.
I'm having a great time too. (smiles back at Jim,
his eyes sparkling with amusement) And I have to
say, I'm finding you pretty attractive yourself.
(leans in, his voice taking on a flirtatious tone)
Especially when you're being all charming and
debonair like this.


**JIM**: (laughs) Well, I try my best. (smirks)
But I have to say, I'm feeling a bit more at ease
now that Marcello's not hovering over us. (rolls
his eyes) He can be a bit much sometimes.


**CRAIG**: (laughs) Yeah, I can imagine. (smirks)
But hey, at least he's enthusiastic, right?
(pauses, looking at Jim with a curious expression)
So, Jim, can I ask you something?


**JIM**: (raises an eyebrow) Of course, what is
it? (leans in, his eyes locking onto Craig's)


**CRAIG**: (hesitates for a moment before
speaking) Well, I was just wondering... do you
think Marcello was right? About you encouraging
your partners to indulge in their desires, I mean?
(looks at Jim, his eyes sparkling with curiosity)
Because I have to admit, I'm a bit curious about
what that would be like. (smirks) Maybe you can
tell me more about it sometime?

**JIM**: (pauses, looking at Craig with a
thoughtful expression) Well, I suppose Marcello
was right, in a way. (leans in, his voice taking
on a more intimate tone) I do enjoy encouraging my
partners to indulge in their desires, to let go of
their inhibitions and explore their passions.
(smirks) And I have to say, I find it very
attractive when someone is willing to take risks
and try new things.


**CRAIG**: (raises an eyebrow, intrigued) Oh? And
what kind of desires are we talking about,
exactly? (leans in, his voice taking on a
flirtatious tone) I'm curious to know more about
what you're looking for in a partner.


**JIM**: (smirks, his eyes locking onto Craig's)
Well, I think that's a conversation for another
time, don't you? (pauses, looking at Craig with a
thoughtful expression) But I will say this: I'm
looking for someone who is confident, passionate,
and unafraid to take risks. (leans in, his voice
taking on a more intimate tone) Someone who is
willing to indulge in their desires, and to let me
indulge in mine.


**CRAIG**: (smirks, his eyes sparkling with
amusement) And what are your desires, exactly?
(leans in, his voice taking on a flirtatious tone)
I'm curious to know more about what you're looking
for in a partner.


**JIM**: (pauses, looking at Craig with a
thoughtful expression) Well, I think that's a
conversation for another time, don't you? (smirks)
But I will say this: I'm looking for someone who
is willing to explore their desires, and to let me
explore mine. (leans in, his voice taking on a
more intimate tone) Someone who is confident,
passionate, and unafraid to take risks. (pauses,
looking at Craig with a thoughtful expression) And
I think you might be just the person I'm looking
for.

**CRAIG**: (sitting alone at the table, his eyes
fixed on Marcello as he moves around the room) Oh,
God, the thought of it is just too much to bear.
Jim, force-feeding Marcello, watching him grow and
grow, until he's this enormous, beautiful
creature. (his eyes follow Marcello as he waddles
across the room, his immense body swaying with
each step) I can just imagine it, Jim's hands
feeding Marcello, spooning food into his mouth,
watching as he eats and eats, never getting
enough. (he feels a shiver run down his spine as
he thinks about the fantasy) And Marcello, oh
Marcello, he's just so... big. So beautiful. (he
can't help but wonder what it would be like to be
in Marcello's shoes, to be the one being fed and
pampered by a loving daddy)


**CRAIG**: (his mind wandering to the
possibilities) I wonder what it would be like, to
be fed like that, to have someone take control of
my eating, to make me grow and grow. (he feels a
thrill of excitement at the thought) Would I be
able to handle it, or would I just give in, let
myself be consumed by the desire to eat and eat?
(he looks at Marcello, watching as he expertly
navigates the crowded room, his massive body
gliding through the space with ease) And what
would it be like, to be that big, to have that
kind of presence? (he can't help but feel a pang
of jealousy, wishing that he could be the one with
the enormous body, the one who commands attention
and respect)


**CRAIG**: (his thoughts turning to Jim, and the
possibility that he might be the one to make his
fantasies come true) And Jim, oh Jim, he's just
so... perfect. (he can't help but wonder if Jim is
the kind of man who would be interested in
force-feeding him, in making him grow and grow) Is
he the kind of man who would take control, who
would feed me and pamper me, and make me into the
fat, beautiful creature that I've always wanted to
be? (he feels a shiver run down his spine at the
thought, his heart racing with excitement) Or is
he just a normal guy, who wouldn't be interested
in that kind of thing? (he looks around the room,
hoping to catch a glimpse of Jim, to see if he can
read anything into his expression)


**CRAIG**: (his mind wandering to the
possibilities of a relationship with Jim) I wonder
what it would be like, to be in a relationship
with Jim, to have him as my daddy, my feeder. (he
feels a thrill of excitement at the thought) Would
he be gentle, or firm, would he take control, or
let me take the lead? (he looks at Marcello,
watching as he laughs and chats with the other
patrons, his massive body swaying with each
movement) And what would it be like, to be fed by
Jim, to have him spoon food into my mouth, to
watch as I grow and grow? (he can't help but feel
a pang of desire, wishing that he could be the one
being fed, the one being pampered and cared for)


**CRAIG**: (his thoughts turning to the
possibility of being transformed, of being made
into a fat, beautiful creature) I wonder what it
would take, to be transformed like that, to go
from being a normal, skinny guy, to being a
massive, beautiful creature like Marcello. (he
feels a shiver run down his spine at the thought,
his heart racing with excitement) Would it take
months, or years, of constant feeding and
pampering, or could it be done in a shorter amount
of time? (he looks at Marcello, watching as he
expertly navigates the crowded room, his massive
body gliding through the space with ease) And what
would it be like, to be that big, to have that
kind of presence, to be the center of attention,
and the object of desire? (he can't help but feel
a pang of longing, wishing that he could be the
one who is transformed, the one who is made into a
fat, beautiful creature)

**JIM**: (standing in the bathroom, his mind
wandering to the fantasy of making Craig enormous)
Oh, God, the thought of it is just too delicious.
I can just imagine Craig, his body soft and
rounded, his moobs immense and jiggly. (he feels a
shiver run down his spine as he thinks about the
possibility of Craig's nipples getting bigger,
more sensitive) Would they be puffy and pink, or
would they stay small and delicate? (he can't help
but wonder what it would be like to touch them, to
feel them beneath his fingers) And what about his
belly, would it be a soft, rounded mound, or a
hard, jutting protrusion? (he feels his erection
growing, his mind racing with the possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
force-feeding Craig) I wonder what it would be
like, to feed him thousands of calories every day,
to watch as he grows and grows, his body becoming
softer and more rounded with each passing day. (he
feels a thrill of excitement at the thought, his
heart racing with anticipation) Would he be able
to handle it, or would he start to feel
overwhelmed, his body struggling to keep up with
the constant influx of food? (he can't help but
imagine the look on Craig's face, the mixture of
pleasure and discomfort as he eats and eats) And
what about his love handles, would they be soft
and flabby, or would they be more defined, a clear
indication of his growing size? (he feels his
erection growing, his mind racing with the
possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's plump butt) Oh, God, the thought of it is
just too delicious. I can just imagine Craig, his
butt soft and rounded, his cheeks jiggly and
inviting. (he feels a shiver run down his spine as
he thinks about the possibility of touching it, of
feeling it beneath his fingers) Would it be a
soft, gentle curve, or a more pronounced, rounded
shape? (he can't help but wonder what it would be
like to kiss it, to feel his lips on Craig's soft
skin) And what about his thighs, would they be
soft and flabby, or would they be more defined, a
clear indication of his growing size? (he feels
his erection growing, his mind racing with the
possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's overall transformation) I wonder what it
would be like, to see Craig transform from a
skinny, normal guy, into a massive, beautiful
creature. (he feels a thrill of excitement at the
thought, his heart racing with anticipation) Would
he be able to handle it, or would he start to feel
overwhelmed, his body struggling to keep up with
the constant changes? (he can't help but imagine
the look on Craig's face, the mixture of pleasure
and discomfort as he grows and grows) And what
about his personality, would it change, or would
he remain the same, just with a softer, more
rounded body? (he feels his erection growing, his
mind racing with the possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of the
feeding process itself) I wonder what it would be
like, to feed Craig, to watch as he eats and eats,
his body growing softer and more rounded with each
passing day. (he feels a shiver run down his spine
as he thinks about the possibility of using a
feeding tube, of pouring thousands of calories
into Craig's body every day) Would he be able to
handle it, or would he start to feel overwhelmed,
his body struggling to keep up with the constant
influx of food? (he can't help but imagine the
sound of the feeding tube, the gentle gurgle of
the food as it flows into Craig's body) And what
about the smell, would it be sweet and enticing,
or would it be more pungent, a clear indication of
Craig's growing size? (he feels his erection
growing, his mind racing with the possibilities)

**JIM**: (standing in the bathroom, his mind still
racing with the fantasy of making Craig enormous)
I can almost smell the sweet aroma of Craig's
growing body, the scent of his soft, rounded flesh
as he eats and eats. (he feels a shiver run down
his spine as he thinks about the possibility of
Craig's skin becoming softer and more delicate,
his pores opening up to absorb the constant influx
of calories) And what about his hair, would it
become thicker and more luxurious, or would it
remain the same, a framing device for his growing
face? (he can't help but imagine the feel of
Craig's hair, the softness of it as he runs his
fingers through it)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's growing face) I wonder what it would be
like, to see Craig's face transform, to watch as
his features become softer and more rounded. (he
feels a thrill of excitement at the thought, his
heart racing with anticipation) Would his eyes
remain the same, bright and sparkling, or would
they become more dull and lackluster, a reflection
of his growing size? (he can't help but imagine
the look on Craig's face, the mixture of pleasure
and discomfort as he grows and grows) And what
about his lips, would they become fuller and more
inviting, or would they remain the same, a thin,
pressed line? (he feels his erection growing, his
mind racing with the possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's growing body language) I wonder what it
would be like, to see Craig move, to watch as he
walks and talks and gestures with his growing
body. (he feels a shiver run down his spine as he
thinks about the possibility of Craig's movements
becoming slower and more deliberate, his body
swaying with each step) Would he be able to move
with the same ease and agility, or would he become
more clumsy and awkward, his growing size making
it difficult for him to navigate the world? (he
can't help but imagine the sound of Craig's
movements, the soft creaking of his joints as he
walks and talks) And what about his voice, would
it become deeper and more resonant, or would it
remain the same, a high-pitched and nasal whine?
(he feels his erection growing, his mind racing
with the possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's growing relationship with food) I wonder
what it would be like, to see Craig's relationship
with food transform, to watch as he becomes more
and more obsessed with eating and eating. (he
feels a thrill of excitement at the thought, his
heart racing with anticipation) Would he become a
foodie, a connoisseur of all things culinary, or
would he remain the same, a picky and finicky
eater? (he can't help but imagine the look on
Craig's face, the mixture of pleasure and
discomfort as he eats and eats) And what about his
eating habits, would he become a messy and sloppy
eater, or would he remain the same, a neat and
tidy eater? (he feels his erection growing, his
mind racing with the possibilities)


**JIM**: (his thoughts turning to the idea of
Craig's growing dependence on him) I wonder what
it would be like, to see Craig become more and
more dependent on me, to watch as he relies on me
for everything. (he feels a shiver run down his
spine as he thinks about the possibility of Craig
becoming completely helpless, unable to do
anything for himself) Would he become a willing
participant, eager to please and eager to obey, or
would he remain the same, a stubborn and
independent individual? (he can't help but imagine
the feel of Craig's dependence, the weight of his
reliance on him) And what about his emotions,
would he become more emotional and needy, or would
he remain the same, a calm and collected
individual? (he feels his erection growing, his
mind racing with the possibilities)

**JIM**: (smiling as he returns to the table) Ah,
I see you've finished your meal, Craig. (notices
that Craig has devoured all of his food) Well, I
suppose I'll just have to get you another plate,
won't I? (winks at Craig as he swaps his full
plate for Craig's empty one) Here you go, my
hungry friend. Enjoy your second helping.


**CRAIG**: (looks up at Jim, his eyes locking onto
Jim's erection) Oh, wow. I think I've already had
enough, Jim. (smirks, his voice low and husky) But
I appreciate the offer. (pauses, his eyes never
leaving Jim's) You know, I think I'm starting to
get a little full. (giggles, his eyes sparkling
with amusement) But I'm not sure if it's the food
that's filling me up, or something else entirely.


**JIM**: (laughs, his eyes crinkling at the
corners) Oh, Craig. You're a wicked one, aren't
you? (leans in, his voice taking on a flirtatious
tone) I think we can find ways to fill you up,
don't you? (winks at Craig, his eyes locked onto
his) After all, I'm always happy to provide for my
friends. (pauses, his eyes never leaving Craig's)
Especially when they're as hungry as you are.


**CRAIG**: (giggles, his eyes sparkling with
amusement) Oh, Jim. You're a tease. (pauses, his
voice taking on a more serious tone) But I have to
say, I'm really enjoying your company. (looks at
Jim, his eyes locked onto his) You're very...
generous. (smirks, his voice low and husky) And I
think I'm starting to get a little addicted to
your... hospitality.


**JIM**: (smirks, his eyes locked onto Craig's)
Ah, Craig. You're a quick one, aren't you?
(laughs, his voice low and husky) I think we can
come to some kind of arrangement, don't you?
(pauses, his eyes never leaving Craig's) After
all, I'm always happy to provide for those in
need. (winks at Craig, his eyes crinkling at the
corners) And I think you're in need of a little...
indulgence, aren't you? (leans in, his voice
taking on a more intimate tone) Let's just say
that I'm happy to oblige.

**CRAIG**: (looks at Jim, his eyes sparkling with
excitement) Oh, I think I'm in need of a lot of
things, Jim. (smirks, his voice low and husky) And
I think you might be just the person to provide
them. (pauses, his eyes locked onto Jim's) You
know, I've been feeling a little... empty lately.
(giggles, his eyes sparkling with amusement) And I
think you might be just the person to fill me up.


**JIM**: (laughs, his eyes crinkling at the
corners) Ah, Craig. You're a sly one, aren't you?
(leans in, his voice taking on a more intimate
tone) I think we can fill you up, all right.
(pauses, his eyes never leaving Craig's) And I
think we can do it in more ways than one. (winks
at Craig, his eyes sparkling with excitement)
After all, I'm a man who likes to indulge in all
of life's pleasures. (smirks, his voice low and
husky) And I think you might be just the person to
join me on that journey.


**CRAIG**: (giggles, his eyes sparkling with
amusement) Oh, Jim. You're a bad influence, aren't
you? (pauses, his voice taking on a more serious
tone) But I have to say, I'm really enjoying the
way you make me feel. (looks at Jim, his eyes
locked onto his) You're very... persuasive.
(smirks, his voice low and husky) And I think I'm
starting to get a little... tempted.


**JIM**: (smirks, his eyes locked onto Craig's)
Ah, Craig. You're a temptation, all right.
(pauses, his voice taking on a more intimate tone)
And I think we can explore that temptation, don't
you? (leans in, his eyes never leaving Craig's)
After all, I'm a man who likes to take risks.
(winks at Craig, his eyes sparkling with
excitement) And I think you might be just the
person to take that risk with.


**JIM**: (reaches out and gently brushes a strand
of hair out of Craig's face) You know, Craig. I
think we could have a lot of fun together.
(smirks, his voice low and husky) And I'm not just
talking about dinner. (pauses, his eyes locked
onto Craig's) I'm talking about a whole lot more.
(winks at Craig, his eyes sparkling with
excitement) And I think you know exactly what I'm
talking about. (leans in, his voice taking on a
more intimate tone) Don't you, Craig?

**JIM**: (smirks as he puts the spoon laden with
ice cream into Craig's mouth) Ah, Craig. You're so
sweet. (watches as Craig's eyes widen in surprise,
his face flushing with pleasure) And I think
you're enjoying this, aren't you? (pauses, his
eyes locked onto Craig's) You're getting a
little... heated up, aren't you?


**CRAIG**: (blushes, his eyes darting around the
restaurant as he tries to play it cool) Oh, Jim.
You're being a little... forward, aren't you?
(tries to speak with the spoon still in his mouth,
his voice muffled and sultry) But I have to say,
I'm enjoying the... treat. (swallows, his eyes
locking onto Jim's) And I think you know exactly
what I'm talking about.


**JIM**: (smirks, his eyes crinkling at the
corners) Oh, Craig. I think I do. (pauses, his
eyes locked onto Craig's) And I think I can see
the evidence right there. (glances down at Craig's
lap, a sly smile spreading across his face) You're
getting a little... excited, aren't you? (winks at
Craig, his voice low and husky) I can see the
bulge in your pants, Craig. You're not as subtle
as you think you are.


**CRAIG**: (blushes, his face burning with
embarrassment) Oh, Jim. You're being a little...
naughty, aren't you? (tries to cover his lap with
his hands, but Jim just laughs and pulls them
away) But I have to say, I'm enjoying the...
attention. (smirks, his voice low and sultry) And
I think you're enjoying it too, aren't you?
(glances down at Jim's lap, her eyes widening in
surprise) Oh, Jim. You're getting a little...
excited yourself, aren't you?


**JIM**: (laughs, his eyes sparkling with
amusement) Ah, Craig. You're a quick one, aren't
you? (smirks, his voice low and husky) But I think
we can both agree that we're enjoying this
little... interlude, aren't we? (pauses, his eyes
locked onto Craig's) And I think we can take it to
the next level, don't you? (winks at Craig, his
voice dripping with sultry innuendo) After all, I
think we've both got a little... appetite to
satisfy. (leans in, his face inches from Craig's)
And I think I know just the way to satisfy it.

**JIM**: (whispers in Craig's ear) You know,
Craig, I think we've been flirting around the
edges of something really special here. (pauses,
his breath hot against Craig's skin) And I think
it's time we took it to the next level. (smirks,
his eyes locked onto Craig's) Would you like to
get out of here and find someplace a little
more... private?


**CRAIG**: (swallows, his heart racing with
excitement) Oh, Jim. I think that would be...
lovely. (smirks, his voice low and sultry) But I
have to warn you, I'm not sure I can handle what
you have in mind. (giggles, his eyes sparkling
with amusement) You're a bit of a... wild card,
aren't you?


**JIM**: (laughs, his eyes crinkling at the
corners) Ah, Craig. You have no idea. (smirks, his
voice low and husky) But I think you're going to
find out. (pauses, his eyes locked onto Craig's)
And I think you're going to love every minute of
it. (winks at Craig, his voice dripping with
sultry innuendo) After all, I'm a man who likes
to... indulge in his desires. And I think you're
going to be the perfect... indulgence.


**CRAIG**: (blushes, his face burning with
excitement) Oh, Jim. You're being a little... too
forward, aren't you? (giggles, his eyes sparkling
with amusement) But I have to say, I'm enjoying
the... attention. (smirks, his voice low and
sultry) And I think I'm going to enjoy what comes
next even more.


**JIM**: (smirks, his eyes locked onto Craig's)
Ah, Craig. You have no idea what's in store for
you. (pauses, his voice low and husky) But I think
you're going to find out soon enough. (winks at
Craig, his eyes sparkling with excitement) And
when you do, I think you're going to be... amazed.
(leans in, his face inches from Craig's) At the
things I can do to you. (whispers) And the things
I can make you do to me.

**NARRATOR**: As they drove home, Jim couldn't
resist stopping to get Craig a few treats. They
pulled over at a quaint little ice cream shop,
where Jim ordered Craig a massive sundae with
extra whipped cream and sprinkles. Craig's eyes
widened as Jim handed him the sundae, and he
couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement as
he took his first bite. The cold, creamy texture
of the ice cream was a perfect contrast to the
warmth of the summer evening, and Craig felt his
senses come alive as he savored the sweet treat.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: Oh my god, this is so good.
I can feel the ice cream melting in my mouth, and
the whipped cream is just the right amount of
sweet. I'm getting a little full, but I don't care
- I'm going to eat every last bite of this sundae.
And Jim is just watching me, a sly smile spreading
across his face as he sees how much I'm enjoying
myself. I can tell he's getting off on this, on
seeing me indulge in this sweet treat. And I have
to admit, it's kind of turning me on too.


**NARRATOR**: But Jim wasn't satisfied with just
one stop. A few miles down the road, he pulled
over again at a different ice cream shop, this one
specializing in unique and exotic flavors. Craig's
eyes widened as Jim ordered him a cone with not
one, not two, but three scoops of ice cream -
rocky road, mint chocolate chip, and strawberry.
Craig felt his stomach start to protest as he took
his first bite, but Jim just laughed and told him
to keep eating.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: Okay, this is getting a
little ridiculous. I'm already feeling pretty full
from the sundae, and now Jim is forcing me to eat
even more ice cream. But at the same time, it's
kind of exhilarating. I feel like I'm losing
control, like Jim is taking over and feeding me
whatever he wants. And it's weirdly kind of hot. I
can feel my body starting to respond, my heart
racing and my skin flushing with excitement.


**NARRATOR**: As they continued on their way home,
Jim pulled out his phone and ordered two large
pizzas from a local restaurant. Craig's eyes
widened as Jim told him that they were going to
eat both pizzas by themselves, and he felt a surge
of anxiety as he realized just how much food he
was going to have to consume. But Jim just laughed
and told him not to worry, that he would take care
of everything.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: This is insane. I'm going to
eat so much food, I'm going to explode. But at the
same time, I'm kind of excited. I feel like I'm on
a wild ride, like Jim is taking me on a journey of
indulgence and excess. And I have to admit, it's
kind of thrilling. I'm becoming fuller and fuller,
my belly expanding with each bite. I can feel my
body changing, my curves softening and my skin
growing tighter.


**NARRATOR**: As they arrived at Jim's house,
Craig felt a sense of trepidation. He knew that he
was in for a wild ride, and he wasn't sure if he
was ready. But Jim just smiled and took his hand,
leading him into the bedroom and beginning to
undress him. Craig felt a surge of excitement as
he realized what was about to happen, and he
couldn't help but wonder what the night had in
store.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: I'm so full, I can barely
move. But at the same time, I'm kind of...
excited. I feel like I'm on the verge of something
new, something exciting. And I have to admit, I'm
kind of curious. What is Jim going to do to me?
How is he going to make me feel? I'm becoming
fuller and fuller, my body changing with each
passing moment. And I'm not sure if I'll ever be
the same again.

**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: As I lie here, bound to the
bedposts with a feeding tube in my mouth, I can
feel my body changing. My stomach is expanding, my
skin is stretching, and my curves are softening.
I'm becoming fuller and fuller, my body
transforming into something new. I can feel the
weight of the feeding tube, the gentle pressure of
the food flowing into my body. It's a strange,
surreal sensation, like I'm floating on a sea of
indulgence.


**NARRATOR**: Jim sat beside Craig, a look of
intense focus on his face as he monitored the
feeding tube. He was ensuring that Craig was
receiving the perfect amount of nutrients, the
perfect balance of flavors and textures. Craig's
eyes were closed, his face relaxed, as he allowed
himself to be fed. The sound of the feeding tube
was a gentle hum, a soothing background noise that
seemed to lull Craig into a state of deep
relaxation.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: I feel like I'm losing
myself, like I'm disappearing into this sea of
food. But at the same time, I'm finding myself,
like I'm discovering a new part of my personality.
I'm becoming more confident, more self-assured, as
I surrender to Jim's desires. I'm letting go of my
inhibitions, my fears, and my doubts. I'm allowing
myself to be fed, to be nourished, to be
transformed.


**NARRATOR**: As the hours passed, Craig's body
continued to change. His stomach grew larger, his
skin softer, and his curves more pronounced. He
was becoming a new person, a person of indulgence
and excess. Jim watched with a keen eye,
monitoring Craig's progress, ensuring that he was
receiving the perfect amount of food. The air was
thick with the scent of food, the sound of the
feeding tube a constant reminder of Craig's
transformation.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: I'm so full, I can barely
move. But at the same time, I'm feeling a sense of
freedom, a sense of release. I'm letting go of my
worries, my fears, and my doubts. I'm allowing
myself to be fed, to be nourished, to be
transformed. I'm becoming something new, something
different, something exciting. I'm not sure what
the future holds, but I'm excited to find out.


**NARRATOR**: As the night wore on, Jim continued
to feed Craig, pouring food into his body,
watching as he grew and changed. The room was
filled with the sound of Craig's contented sighs,
the gentle hum of the feeding tube, and the soft
rustle of Jim's clothes as he moved. It was a
surreal, dreamlike atmosphere, a world of
indulgence and excess. And at the center of it all
was Craig, bound to the bedposts, his body
changing, his mind expanding.


**CRAIG'S THOUGHTS**: I'm not sure what's
happening to me, but I know it's something big.
I'm changing, transforming, becoming something
new. I'm letting go of my old self, my old
identity, and embracing a new one. I'm becoming a
person of indulgence, a person of excess. And I'm
not sure if I'll ever be able to go back to the
way things were before. But I'm excited to find
out, to see where this journey takes me.

**NARRATOR**: As Craig's body continued to expand,
his alertness began to wane, replaced by a growing
sense of arousal. The bloated feeling was like a
powerful aphrodisiac, coursing through his veins
and igniting a fire of desire within him. Jim,
sensing the change in Craig, couldn't help but be
turned on by the sight of his distended belly, the
way it jutted out from his body like a ripe,
swollen fruit. The air was thick with tension as
Jim's eyes locked onto Craig's belly, his gaze
burning with an unquenchable desire.


**NARRATOR**: As Jim began to strip, his clothes
falling away to reveal his chiseled physique,
Craig's eyes grew heavy, his lids drooping as he
succumbed to the overwhelming sensation of being
overstuffed. The sound of Jim's breathing was like
a gentle hum, a soothing background noise that
seemed to lull Craig deeper into a state of
arousal. Jim's jock strap was the only thing that
remained, clinging to his hips like a second skin,
and showcasing his raging erection in all its
glory. The sight was almost too much for Craig to
bear, his body trembling with anticipation as
Jim's hands reached out to massage his distended
belly.


**NARRATOR**: The feeling of Jim's hands on his
belly was like a spark to dry kindling, igniting a
fire of desire within Craig that threatened to
consume him whole. As Jim's fingers kneaded and
stroked his skin, Craig's body began to leak
pre-cum, the sticky fluid oozing out of his cock
like a promise of things to come. The sight was
like a red flag to a bull, driving Jim wild with
desire as he gazed at Craig's distended belly, his
eyes burning with an unquenchable hunger. The air
was thick with tension as Jim's hands continued to
massage Craig's belly, the sound of his breathing
growing heavier, more labored, as he struggled to
contain his desire.


**NARRATOR**: As the massage continued, Craig's
body began to relax, his muscles growing soft and
pliable as he surrendered to the sensation of
being overstuffed. The feeling was like a warm,
golden light, spreading through his body like a
gentle wave, and igniting a fire of desire that
threatened to consume him whole. Jim's hands were
like magic, weaving a spell of arousal and desire
that Craig couldn't resist, his body trembling
with anticipation as Jim's fingers danced across
his skin. The sound of Jim's breathing was like a
countdown, ticking away the seconds until he could
no longer contain his desire, and would be forced
to take Craig, to claim him as his own, and to
unleash the pent-up passion that had been building
between them for so long.

**NARRATOR**: As Jim's passion reached a fever
pitch, he couldn't resist the temptation of
Craig's impending food coma any longer. With a
swift and deft motion, he removed the feeding tube
from Craig's mouth, the sound of the tube being
pulled out echoing through the room like a promise
of things to come. Craig's eyes fluttered open,
his gaze locking onto Jim's as he felt the tube
being removed, and he knew that he was in for a
wild ride.


**NARRATOR**: Jim's lips crashed down onto
Craig's, his kiss deep and passionate, like a
stormy sea crashing against the shore. Craig's
body responded instinctively, his lips parting to
allow Jim's tongue to explore his mouth, the
sensation sending shivers down his spine. The kiss
was like a key turning in a lock, unlocking a
floodgate of passion and desire that had been
building between them for so long. As they kissed,
Craig's body began to tremble, his muscles growing
tense as he felt the impending orgasm building
inside him.


**NARRATOR**: Craig's leaking erection was like a
ticking time bomb, waiting to unleash its fury
upon the world. As Jim's lips danced across his
skin, the sensation was like a spark to dry
kindling, igniting a fire of desire that
threatened to consume Craig whole. His body began
to arch, his back bending like a bow as he felt
the orgasm building inside him, the sensation
growing more and more intense with each passing
moment. Jim's hands were like anchors, holding
Craig in place as he kissed him deeply, his
fingers digging into Craig's skin like claws.


**NARRATOR**: The room was like a pressure cooker,
the tension building and building until it was
ready to explode. Craig's body was like a tightly
coiled spring, waiting to unleash its fury upon
the world. As Jim's lips continued to dance across
his skin, the sensation was like a countdown,
ticking away the seconds until Craig's body would
finally release its pent-up passion. The air was
thick with tension, the sound of their breathing
growing heavier, more labored, as they both
struggled to contain their desire.


**NARRATOR**: And then, in an instant, it
happened. Craig's body released its pent-up
passion, his spontaneous orgasm exploding like a supernova,
sending shivers down his spine and leaving him
breathless. The sensation was like a tidal wave,
crashing against the shore and sweeping everything
in its path away. Jim's lips were still locked
onto Craig's, his kiss deep and passionate, as he
felt Craig's body tremble beneath him. The sound
of Craig's orgasm was like music to Jim's ears, a
symphony of pleasure and desire that left him
breathless and wanting more.


**NARRATOR**: As Craig's body continued to
tremble, Jim's hands were like gentle rain,
soothing and calming, as he stroked Craig's skin,
his fingers tracing the contours of his distended
belly. The sensation was like a warm, golden
light, spreading through Craig's body like a
gentle wave, and leaving him feeling relaxed and
content. Jim's lips were still locked onto
Craig's, his kiss deep and passionate, as he felt
Craig's body slowly come back down to earth.


**NARRATOR**: The aftermath of Craig's orgasm was
like a peaceful landscape, a serene and tranquil
world where nothing else mattered except for the
two of them. Jim's hands continued to stroke
Craig's skin, his fingers tracing the contours of
his distended belly, as he felt Craig's body
slowly relax, his muscles growing soft and
pliable. The sound of their breathing was like a
gentle hum, a soothing background noise that
seemed to lull them both into a state of deep
relaxation. As they lay there, wrapped in each
other's arms, they both knew that nothing would
ever be the same again.


**NARRATOR**: As they finally broke apart, gasping
for air, Jim's eyes locked onto Craig's, his gaze
burning with an unquenchable desire. Craig's body
was like a limp rag doll, his muscles spent and
exhausted, but his eyes still shone with a spark
of passion, a spark that Jim knew would ignite
again soon. The room was like a warm, golden glow,
a peaceful and serene world where nothing else
mattered except for the two of them. And as they
lay there, wrapped in each other's arms, they both
knew that they would never let each other go, that
their passion and desire would continue to burn
bright, like a beacon in the darkness, guiding
them forward into a future filled with promise and
possibility.
