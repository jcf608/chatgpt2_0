The prompt describes a detailed and intimate
scenario between two individuals, Sammy and Daddy,
who are in a dominant-submissive relationship.
Sammy, who is extremely obese, finds pleasure in
being fed and dominated by Daddy, who is muscular
and commanding. The scenario involves Daddy
feeding Sammy a variety of foods, followed by
forcing him to drink beer from a keg, all while
emphasizing the power dynamic and control in their
relationship. The scenario culminates in Sammy
experiencing a intense orgasm, with Daddy guiding
his movements and using his body for his own
pleasure, reinforcing the themes of dominance,
submission, and the blurring of boundaries between
pleasure, control, and fulfillment.

🤖 Sammy:
The sheer bliss that envelops me as I surrender to
my insatiable hunger, allowing myself to balloon
to unprecedented sizes. It's a twisted dance of
elation and embarrassment, as I revel in the
thrill of being so fat that I can no longer grasp
my own genitals, my belly a massive, jiggling
obstacle that renders self-pleasure a distant
memory. And yet, in this state of utter gluttony,
I've discovered a perverse secret: if I overstuff
myself to the point of bursting, I can still
achieve orgasm, but only through the most extreme
and decadent means.


As I lie here, my body a sprawling, quivering mass
of flesh, I'm overcome with a mix of shame and
exhilaration. My thighs, once separate and
distinct, now merge into a single, undulating
entity, a fleshy tidal wave that threatens to
engulf me whole. My belly, a gargantuan, pulsing
drum, beats out a rhythm of desire and
desperation, as if urging me to consume even more,
to push the boundaries of my gluttony to
unprecedented heights.


And so, I eat, and eat, and eat some more, the
food a never-ending river of pleasure and pain, as
my body stretches and expands, my skin taut and
sensitive, my nerve endings screaming in delight.
It's a masochistic waltz, a delicate balance of
pleasure and discomfort, as I teeter on the edge
of ecstasy and agony.


But the moment of truth arrives when, in a frenzy
of overindulgence, I surpass even my own limits,
and my body, now a bloated, quivering monstrosity,
reaches a critical mass of pleasure and pain. It's
as if my very cells are screaming in release, as a
spontaneous orgasm erupts, a volcanic explosion of
ecstasy that leaves me gasping, trembling, and
utterly spent.


In these moments, I'm torn asunder by conflicting
emotions: shame and embarrassment at my grotesque
size, my utter lack of self-control, and my
willingness to surrender to the most base and
primal of desires; and yet, simultaneously, I'm
elevated to a state of unadulterated bliss, my
body and mind united in a singular, overriding
passion, as I succumb to the pure, unadulterated
pleasure of being a glutton, a feeder, a slave to
my own insatiable hunger.


It's a perverse, twisted thrill, this dance of
excess and indulgence, and yet, I'm hopelessly,
irretrievably enthralled, a willing participant in
this grotesque, beautiful waltz of flesh and
desire. For in the depths of my obesity, I've
discovered a strange, warped liberation, a freedom
to indulge, to excess, and to succumb to the most
primal, base aspects of my nature, unencumbered by
the constraints of conventional morality or
societal expectation. I am a monster, a creature
of unbridled appetite, and in this monstrousness,
I've found a strange, perverse solace, a sense of
self and purpose that eludes me in the mundane,
everyday world.

🤖 Sammy:
The indignity, the shame, the utter mortification
of it all. My fatpad, that gargantuan, quivering
mass of flesh, had finally achieved the
unthinkable: it had swallowed up my cock,
rendering it all but invisible, a tiny,
insignificant nubbin lost in a sea of blubber. It
was the ultimate sign of my extreme obesity, the
final, humiliating milestone on my journey into
the abyss of gluttony.


And yet, I was reluctant, no, downright terrified,
to admit it to Daddy. I knew he'd be thrilled,
ecstatic even, at the prospect of my utter,
complete, and total submission to my hunger, my
body a bloated, quivering monument to his
dominance and control. But I was ashamed, ashamed
of my size, my shape, my very existence as a fat,
sloppy, gluttonous mess.


But, as I lay there, my body a sprawling,
trembling mass of flesh, I knew I had to confess,
to admit the truth to Daddy, no matter how
humiliating it might be. I took a deep breath, my
voice barely above a whisper, and stammered out
the words, "D-Daddy, my fatpad... it's swallowed
up my cock." The words hung in the air, a
challenge, a confession, a plea for forgiveness
and understanding.


And then, it happened. Daddy's eyes, those
piercing, commanding orbs, locked onto mine, and I
saw it, the spark of excitement, the thrill of
triumph, the unadulterated joy that radiated from
his very being. He was ecstatic, over the moon,
utterly delighted by my confession, and in that
instant, I knew I'd given him the greatest gift of
all: the knowledge of my complete and utter
submission to my hunger, to my gluttony, to my
obesity.


But what happened next, I could never have
anticipated. As I watched, transfixed, Daddy's
body began to tremble, his muscles tensing, his
eyes rolling back in his head, and then, in a
burst of pure, unadulterated ecstasy, he came, his
orgasm instantaneous, explosive, and utterly,
completely, and totally overwhelming. It was as if
my words, my confession, had unleashed a torrent
of pent-up desire, a floodgate of passion and
pleasure that had been waiting, patiently, for the
perfect moment to strike.


And in that moment, I knew I'd given Daddy the
ultimate gift, the knowledge of my complete and
utter surrender to my obesity, to my gluttony, to
my hunger. I'd given him the key to unlocking his
deepest, most primal desires, and in doing so, I'd
found a strange, perverse sense of power, of
control, of dominance, even as I lay there, a
helpless, quivering mass of flesh, my fatpad
swallowing up my cock, my body a monument to my
own, utter, complete, and total submission.
