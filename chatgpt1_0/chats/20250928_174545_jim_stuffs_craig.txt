Five years had passed since Jim and Craig first met, and their relationship had
evolved into something much more intense and dominant. Jim had always been the
more controlling partner, but now he was extremely dominant, insisting that
Craig wear a feed bag at all times. Craig had grown accustomed to the feeling of
the bag against his skin, but he still felt a twinge of resistance whenever Jim
tightened the straps.
As they sat in their living room, Craig's enormous body sprawled out on the
couch, Jim leaned over and adjusted the feed bag, making sure it was secure.
"You know the rules, Craig," he said, his voice firm but gentle. "The feed bag
stays on at all times. You're not allowed to take it off without my permission."
Craig sighed, feeling a mild objection rise up in him. But he knew better than
to argue with Jim. Instead, he nodded, his cheeks flushing with a mixture of
embarrassment and arousal. As he sat there, he couldn't help but think about how
turned on he was by Jim's dominance. He loved the way Jim controlled him, the
way he dictated every aspect of his life.
But despite his arousal, Craig couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. His
body had grown so enormous that he could no longer reach his cock, which was
buried under rolls of his fat pad. He had tried to touch himself, to pleasure
himself, but it was impossible. He was trapped in his own body, unable to access
his own desires.
Jim, on the other hand, was extremely turned on by Craig's situation. He loved
the fact that Craig was so big, so helpless, that he couldn't even touch his own
cock. He would often tease Craig about it, humiliating him and making him feel
like a helpless, pathetic creature.
"You're so big and fat, Craig," Jim would say, his voice dripping with contempt.
"You can't even reach your own cock. You're completely at my mercy, aren't you?"
Craig would nod, feeling a surge of shame and humiliation. But at the same time,
he would feel a thrill of arousal, a sense of excitement and anticipation. He
knew that Jim was turned on by his helplessness, and that thought alone was
enough to make him hard.
As they sat there, Jim reached out and stroked Craig's belly, his fingers
tracing the curves of his fat pad. "You're so beautiful, Craig," he said, his
voice full of admiration. "So big and round and helpless. I love the way you
look, the way you feel."
Craig felt a surge of emotion, a mix of sadness and arousal. He knew that he was
trapped in his own body, unable to escape the prison of his own fat. But at the
same time, he was grateful to Jim, grateful for the way he cared for him, the
way he controlled him.
As Jim continued to stroke his belly, Craig felt himself becoming more and more
aroused. He knew that he was helpless, that he was completely at Jim's mercy.
But he also knew that he was loved, that Jim cared for him deeply.
And so, Craig sat there, his feed bag securely in place, his body enormous and
helpless. He was a prisoner of his own desires, a slave to Jim's dominance. But
he was also happy, happy to be loved and cared for, happy to be a part of Jim's
world.
As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks turned into months, Craig's body
continued to grow. He became bigger and bigger, his fat pad expanding to
enormous proportions. And Jim was always there, controlling him, dominating him,
humiliating him.
But Craig didn't mind. He was happy to be Jim's slave, happy to be controlled
and dominated. He knew that he was loved, that Jim cared for him deeply. And he
knew that he would always be happy, as long as Jim was by his side.
As they sat there, Jim leaned over and kissed Craig's belly, his lips tracing
the curves of his fat pad. "I love you, Craig," he said, his voice full of
emotion. "I love the way you look, the way you feel. You're my perfect slave, my
perfect feeder."
Craig felt a surge of emotion, a mix of sadness and arousal. He knew that he was
trapped in his own body, unable to escape the prison of his own fat. But he also
knew that he was loved, that Jim cared for him deeply. And he knew that he would
always be happy, as long as Jim was by his side.

As Jim looked at Craig, he couldn't help but think about how fuckin' huge his
boy's chest was. Craig's boy boobs were like two massive, pendulous sacks of
flesh, hanging down from his chest like a pair of oversized udders. They were so
big and floppy, they seemed to swing back and forth like a pair of metronomes,
hypnotizing Jim with their rhythmic motion.
Jim's eyes were glued to Craig's nipples, which were like two gigantic,
distended buttons, poking out from the center of each breast like a pair of
oversized rivets. They were so big and sensitive, Jim could see them twitching
and throbbing with every beat of Craig's heart.
As Jim's gaze traveled down Craig's body, he couldn't help but stare at his
enormous belly. It was like a gigantic, inflated balloon, stretching out from
Craig's waist like a massive, distended tumor. The skin was stretched so tight,
it seemed to be on the verge of bursting, like a ripe, overgrown fruit ready to
split open at any moment.
Jim's hands itched to touch Craig's belly, to feel the soft, yielding flesh and
the subtle ridges and creases that crisscrossed its surface. He loved to grab
onto Craig's belly, to squeeze it and play with it like a big, fluffy stress
ball.
As Jim looked at Craig's thighs, he couldn't help but think about how massive
and fat they were. They were like two gigantic, granite pillars, supporting
Craig's enormous body like a pair of colossal, blubber columns. The skin was
smooth and unblemished, like a pair of freshly shaved legs, and the muscles
rippled and flexed beneath the surface like a pair of living, breathing
serpents.
Jim's eyes were drawn to Craig's butt, which was like a massive, sprawling
landscape of flesh, with rolling hills and deep valleys that seemed to stretch
on forever. The cheeks were so big and round, they seemed to be inflated with
air, like a pair of oversized, rubbery balloons. And the crack between them was
like a deep, yawning chasm, a gigantic, gaping void that seemed to swallow
everything in its path.
As Jim looked at Craig's body, he couldn't help but feel a sense of lust and
desire. He wanted to touch and caress and fondle, to feel the soft, yielding
flesh and the subtle ridges and creases that crisscrossed its surface. He wanted
to grab onto Craig's belly and squeeze it, to play with his nipples and suck on
his breasts. He wanted to fuck Craig's deep, cavernous belly button, to feel his
9-inch cock sliding in and out of the soft, squishy flesh.
Jim's mind was consumed by thoughts of sex and lust, his body burning with
desire for Craig's massive, sprawling form. He wanted to dominate and control,
to make Craig do his bidding and submit to his every whim. And Craig, sensing
Jim's lust and desire, seemed to be growing bigger and bigger, his body
inflating with air like a massive, rubbery balloon.
As Jim sat next to Craig on the couch, he felt a sense of raw, animalistic
desire. He wanted to fuck and suck and lick, to devour Craig's massive body like
a hungry, ravenous beast. And Craig, sensing Jim's desire, seemed to be growing
more and more submissive, his body relaxing and yielding to Jim's every touch.
It was a primal, animalistic relationship, driven by lust and desire rather than
love and adoration. Jim was the dominant one, the one who controlled the sex and
the food. And Craig was the submissive one, the one who loved to be controlled
and dominated by Jim.
As Jim looked at Craig, he couldn't help but feel a sense of raw, unbridled
lust. He wanted to fuck and suck and lick, to devour Craig's massive body like a
hungry, ravenous beast. And Craig, sensing Jim's desire, seemed to be growing
bigger and bigger, his body inflating with air like a massive, rubbery balloon.
 
As I sat on the couch, I couldn't help but feel a sense of carnal lust wash over
me. My body was so fat, so enormous, that I felt like a giant, lumbering beast,
driven solely by my desires and appetites. And my appetite for food was
insatiable, a constant, gnawing hunger that seemed to grow more and more intense
with every passing moment.
I loved being fat, loved the way my body felt, all soft and squishy and
yielding. I loved the way my belly jiggled and wobbled, the way my thighs rubbed
together, the way my butt cheeks squeezed together. And I loved the way Jim
looked at me, the way he stared at my body with a mixture of lust and adoration.
As Jim approached me, a tray of food in his hands, I felt my mouth begin to
water in anticipation. I loved being stuffed, loved the feeling of my mouth
being overfull, of my belly being stretched to its limits. And Jim knew just how
to do it, just how to make me feel like a giant, insatiable beast, devouring
everything in my path.
"Open up, Craig," Jim said, his voice low and husky, as he approached me with
the tray. "I've got a special treat for you, something that's going to make your
taste buds sing."
I opened my mouth, feeling a sense of anticipation and excitement. Jim began to
feed me, shoveling food into my mouth with a spoon, making sure that I was
overfull, that my mouth was stuffed to the brim. And I felt a sense of carnal
lust wash over me, a sense of pure, unadulterated pleasure.
As I ate, I couldn't help but think about how much I loved being fat, loved the
way my body felt, all soft and squishy and yielding. I loved the way my belly
jiggled and wobbled, the way my thighs rubbed together, the way my butt cheeks
squeezed together. And I loved the way Jim looked at me, the way he stared at my
body with a mixture of lust and adoration.
As the food continued to flow into my mouth, I felt my senses begin to overload,
felt my body begin to feel like it was going to burst, like it was going to
explode from the sheer amount of food that I was consuming. And I loved it,
loved the feeling of being overfull, of being stuffed to the brim.
Jim continued to feed me, his eyes locked on mine, his face twisted into a
mixture of lust and adoration. And I could see the excitement in his eyes, the
thrill of watching me eat, of watching me devour everything in my path.
As the meal finally came to an end, I felt a sense of satisfaction wash over me,
a sense of pure, unadulterated pleasure. I was so full, so stuffed, that I could
hardly move, hardly breathe. And I loved it, loved the feeling of being
overfull, of being stuffed to the brim.
Jim leaned over, his face inches from mine, and whispered, "You're so beautiful,
Craig, so gorgeous. I love watching you eat, love watching you devour everything
in your path."
And I felt a sense of carnal lust wash over me, a sense of pure, unadulterated
pleasure. I loved being fat, loved the way my body felt, all soft and squishy
and yielding. And I loved Jim, loved the way he looked at me, the way he stared
at my body with a mixture of lust and adoration.
As we sat there, Jim's face inches from mine, I felt a sense of connection, a
sense of pure, unadulterated lust. We were two people, connected by our desires,
connected by our appetites. And I knew that I would never let go, never let Jim
go, as long as he continued to feed me, to stuff me, to make me feel like a
giant, insatiable beast.

As I lay on the bed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and
desperation. Jim was out of town, and I was left to my own devices, with no one
to feed me or take care of my needs. And to make matters worse, I was feeling
incredibly horny, my body aching with desire.
I tried to reach down and touch myself, to jerk off and relieve some of the
tension that was building up inside me. But it was no use. My belly was too big,
too round, and it got in the way of my hands. I couldn't even reach my own cock,
let alone touch it or stroke it.
I tried and tried, twisting and turning, trying to find a way to get my hands on
my own body. But it was like trying to solve a puzzle, a puzzle that I couldn't
figure out. My fat was in the way, and I couldn't seem to get past it.
I felt a sense of despair wash over me, a sense of hopelessness. I was trapped
in my own body, unable to even touch myself. And to make matters worse, I was
feeling more and more frustrated, more and more desperate.
I tried to use a pillow, to prop myself up and get my hands on my own body. But
it was no use. The pillow slipped and slid, and I ended up with my face buried
in the mattress, unable to breathe.
I tried to use a mirror, to see what I was doing and get a better angle. But it
was no use. The mirror showed me a reflection of a fat, sweaty man, with a belly
that was so big it looked like it was going to burst.
I felt a sense of shame and embarrassment wash over me, a sense of disgust. I
was a fat, disgusting pig, unable to even take care of my own needs. And to make
matters worse, I was feeling more and more desperate, more and more frustrated.
As the hours ticked by, I grew more and more despondent. I was trapped in my own
body, unable to even touch myself. And I knew that I wouldn't be able to get any
relief until Jim came back, until he came back and took care of me.
I felt a sense of dependence on Jim, a sense of need. I needed him to take care
of me, to feed me and touch me and make me feel like a man. And without him, I
was lost, alone and adrift in a sea of frustration and despair.
As the night wore on, I grew more and more exhausted. I was tired and hungry,
and my body was aching with desire. And I knew that I wouldn't be able to get
any rest until Jim came back, until he came back and took care of me.
I finally drifted off to sleep, my body exhausted and my mind reeling with
frustration and despair. And as I slept, I dreamed of Jim, dreamed of his touch
and his care. I dreamed of him feeding me, of him stuffing me with food until I
was full and satisfied.
And when I woke up, I felt a sense of hope, a sense of renewal. I knew that Jim
would be back soon, and that he would take care of me. And I knew that I would
be able to get the relief that I so desperately needed, the relief that only Jim
could provide.
As I lay on the bed, waiting for Jim to come back, I felt a sense of
anticipation, a sense of excitement. I knew that he would be back soon, and that
he would take care of me. And I knew that I would be able to get the relief that
I so desperately needed, the relief that only Jim could provide.
And when Jim finally walked through the door, I felt a sense of joy, a sense of
relief. I was finally going to get the care and attention that I so desperately
needed, the care and attention that only Jim could provide.
"Hey, baby," Jim said, as he walked over to the bed. "I'm home. And I've got a
special surprise for you."
I looked up at him, my eyes filled with hope and anticipation. And I knew that I
was in for a treat, a treat that only Jim could provide.

As Jim approached the bed, I could see the excitement in his eyes. He was eager
to get started, to feed me and fuck me and make me feel like a king. And I was
eager to let him, to surrender to his desires and let him take control.
"Get ready, baby," Jim said, as he began to undress me. "I've got a big meal
planned for you, and it's going to be a real feast."
I felt a shiver run down my spine as Jim's hands touched my skin. He was so
gentle, so caring, and yet so rough and demanding at the same time. It was a
contradictions that I loved, a contradictions that made me feel alive.
As Jim continued to undress me, I could feel my cock growing harder and harder.
It was a massive, throbbing beast, and it was eager to be set free. And Jim knew
just how to do it, just how to make me feel like a man.
"Spread your legs, baby," Jim said, as he climbed onto the bed. "I've got a big
surprise for you, and it's going to make you feel so good."
I spread my legs, feeling a sense of excitement and anticipation. And then Jim's
hands were on my cock, stroking it and teasing it and making me feel like I was
going to explode.
"You're so big, baby," Jim said, as he looked at my cock. "You're so huge and
hard, and I just can't get enough of you."
I felt a sense of pride and satisfaction as Jim spoke. I loved being big, loved
being huge and hard and demanding. And I knew that Jim loved it too, loved the
way I made him feel.
As Jim continued to stroke my cock, I could feel myself getting closer and
closer to the edge. I was going to come, and I was going to come big. And Jim
knew it, knew that I was on the verge of exploding.
"Come on, baby," Jim said, as he leaned in close. "Come for me, and let me taste
your sweet, sweet cum."
I felt a sense of release, a sense of freedom, as I let go and came. It was a
massive, explosive orgasm, and it was all for Jim. And as I came, I could feel
Jim's mouth on my cock, sucking and licking and swallowing every last drop.
"You're so delicious, baby," Jim said, as he looked up at me. "You're so sweet
and tasty, and I just can't get enough of you."
I felt a sense of satisfaction, a sense of contentment, as Jim spoke. I loved
being eaten, loved being sucked and licked and swallowed. And I knew that Jim
loved it too, loved the way I made him feel.
As we lay there, Jim's head still buried in my crotch, I could feel a sense of
peace and tranquility. It was a feeling that I had never experienced before, a
feeling that I never wanted to end.
And then Jim looked up at me, his eyes shining with excitement and desire. "I've
got another surprise for you, baby," he said. "Something that's going to make
you feel even better than you do now."
I felt a sense of anticipation, a sense of excitement, as Jim spoke. I had no
idea what he had planned, but I knew that it was going to be good. And as Jim
began to move, to shift and adjust his position, I could feel a sense of
excitement building inside me.
"What is it, Jim?" I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.
"You'll see, baby," Jim said, as he smiled. "You'll see, and you'll love it. I
promise."
And with that, Jim began to move, to shift and adjust his position. And as he
did, I could feel a sense of excitement building inside me, a sense of
anticipation and desire. I had no idea what Jim had planned, but I knew that it
was going to be good. And as I waited, my heart pounding with excitement, I
could feel a sense of peace and tranquility wash over me. It was a feeling that
I had never experienced before, a feeling that I never wanted to end.
