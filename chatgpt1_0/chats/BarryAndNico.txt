**Barry:** *panting, smiling softly as he rolls
over onto Nico, his massive belly and soft body
enveloping Nico's more compact frame* Oh, Nico...
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to crush you.


**Nico:** *surprised, then overwhelmed with
sensation, his eyes widening in awe* No, Barry...
don't apologize. This... this feels incredible.
*His voice trembles as he wraps his arms around
Barry, pulling him closer, feeling the warmth and
weight of Barry's body.*


**Barry:** *concerned, but also pleased* Really?
You're not uncomfortable?


**Nico:** *breathlessly, his body starting to
react* Uncomfortable? No... it's just... so much
of you. *He gasps, feeling his body respond to the
pressure and the sensation of being under Barry's
massive, soft form.* Oh, Barry... *His voice
trails off as he feels himself getting hard again,
the sensation of Barry's blubber enveloping him
sending him into a state of intense arousal.*


**Barry:** *noticing the change in Nico's body, a
blush rising to his cheeks* Nico? Are you...?


**Nico:** *unable to speak, he nods, his eyes
locked on Barry's as he feels himself building
towards another orgasm. The feeling of Barry's
soft, yielding flesh against his own body is
almost too much to bear.*


**Barry:** *smiling gently, he leans down, his
lips brushing against Nico's ear* I'm glad you
like it. I was worried I might be too much for
you.


**Nico:** *his voice barely above a whisper, his
body tense with impending release* You're perfect,
Barry. Just... just like this. *He arches his
back, pushing himself more firmly into the cushion
of Barry's belly, and suddenly, he's climaxing
again, the sensation of Barry's weight and warmth
triggering a second, spontaneous orgasm.*


**Barry:** *holding Nico close, feeling a deep
sense of satisfaction and love* Oh, Nico... I'm so
glad you're enjoying this. *He kisses Nico's
forehead, his chest, holding him tightly as Nico
rides out his orgasm, surrounded by the soft,
comforting bulk of Barry's body.*


**Nico:** *breathless, spent, but still wrapped
tightly around Barry* I love you, Barry. All of
you. *His voice is muffled against Barry's chest,
but the sincerity and adoration are clear.*


**Barry:** *smiling, feeling loved and accepted* I
love you too, Nico. And I'm glad you can
appreciate me, all of me. *He chuckles softly, his
belly jiggling with the movement, and Nico feels
another wave of affection and arousal, knowing
that he has found someone who loves him for who he
is, and someone he loves just the same.*

**Nico's diary - Month 1:**



I can barely believe what's happening. One minute
I was in love with Barry, enjoying our intimate
moments together, and the next, I found myself
locked in his ensuite bathroom with no way out. At
first, I was terrified, thinking this was some
kind of twisted game. But then Barry explained
that he wanted me to gorge, to eat as much as I
could, to grow bigger, softer, and more like him.
I was horrified, not just because of the idea
itself, but because I had always taken pride in my
gym-built body. The thought of intentionally
letting myself go, of becoming fat and bloated,
was repulsive to me.


But Barry's enthusiasm was infectious, and his
words, though shocking, held a strange allure. He
promised me that I would love my new body, that I
would feel more confident, more sensual, and more
loved than ever before. He brought me tray after
tray of food, each one more decadent than the
last, and at first, I ate out of obligation, out
of a desire to please him. But as the days turned
into weeks, I started to notice changes in my
body. My muscles, once so defined, began to
soften, and a layer of fat started to form around
my midsection. It was a strange, tingling
sensation, like my body was awakening to a new
reality.


I'm still not sure how I feel about all of this.
Part of me is terrified of losing my identity, of
becoming someone I no longer recognize. But
another part of me, a part that's growing louder
by the day, is excited, eager to see where this
journey will take me. Barry's love and adoration
are palpable, and when he looks at me, I feel like
I'm the only person in the world. He tells me that
I'm beautiful, that my growing body is a work of
art, and for the first time in my life, I'm
starting to believe it.


**Month 2:**



It's been two months since I've been locked in
this bathroom, and I can barely recognize myself.
My body has changed so much, so fast. The fat
around my midsection has grown significantly, and
my love handles are starting to spill over the
edges of my pants. My thighs, once so lean and
muscular, are now soft and jiggly, and my face has
taken on a rounder, more cherubic quality. It's
disorienting, to say the least, but Barry's
constant praise and affection have made me feel
more confident than I ever thought possible.


The eating is still a challenge, though. Barry
brings me these enormous meals, and at first, I
thought I'd never be able to finish them. But he's
patient, encouraging me to take bite after bite,
to push past my comfort zone and into a new realm
of indulgence. And the strange thing is, it's
starting to feel good. The act of eating, of
consuming, has become a sensual experience, like
my body is awakening to a new kind of pleasure. I
find myself looking forward to meals, anticipating
the feeling of food filling my belly, of my body
growing softer and more voluptuous.


Barry's touch has changed, too. He used to be
gentle, tentative, but now he's more assertive,
more possessive. He loves to run his hands over my
growing body, to squeeze my fat and tell me how
beautiful I am. It's a strange kind of intimacy,
but it feels authentic, like we're connecting on a
deeper level than ever before. I'm starting to
realize that my body is no longer just my own, but
a vessel for Barry's love and desire. And that
thought, though terrifying at first, is starting
to excite me.


**Month 3:**



I've been thinking a lot about my identity lately,
about who I am and what I want. Being locked in
this bathroom, forced to eat and grow, has been a
kind of liberation. I've always been so focused on
my body, on maintaining this perfect, muscular
physique, but now I'm starting to see that there's
more to life than just physical appearance.
Barry's love has shown me that beauty comes in all
shapes and sizes, that the soft and the round can
be just as desirable as the lean and the muscular.


My body is changing so fast, it's hard to keep up.
My belly is growing, spilling over the edges of my
pants, and my thighs are getting softer and more
jiggly by the day. I've started to notice that my
skin is changing, too, becoming more sensitive,
more responsive to touch. Barry loves to run his
hands over my body, to explore every nook and
cranny, and it's like my skin is alive, vibrating
with pleasure.


The eating is still a challenge, but it's becoming
more enjoyable. 
I've started to look forward to meals, to the
feeling of food filling my belly and my body
growing softer and more voluptuous. It's a strange
kind of pleasure, but it's one that I'm learning
to appreciate. Barry's enthusiasm is infectious,
and when he watches me eat, his eyes shining with
excitement, I feel like I'm doing something truly
special.


As the days turn into weeks, I'm starting to
notice changes in my behavior, too. I'm more
relaxed, more at ease, and I find myself enjoying
the simple things in life. Eating, sleeping,
lounging in the bath - these activities have
become my new hobbies, and I'm surprised by how
much joy I can derive from them. Barry's love and
acceptance have given me the freedom to let go, to
surrender to my desires and indulge in the
pleasures of the flesh.


**Month 4:**



It's hard to believe it's been four months since
I've been locked in this bathroom. My body has
changed so much, I barely recognize myself. I've
gained a significant amount of weight, and my body
is now a soft, rounded shape. My belly is
enormous, spilling over the edges of my pants, and
my thighs are so jiggly that they wobble when I
walk. My face is round and full, and my skin is
sensitive and responsive to touch.


Despite the initial shock and discomfort, I'm
starting to feel a sense of pride and ownership
over my new body. Barry's constant praise and
admiration have helped me to see myself in a new
light, and I'm starting to realize that beauty
comes in all shapes and sizes. I'm no longer the
lean, muscular man I once was, but I'm something
new, something unique, and something truly
special.


The eating is still a challenge, but it's becoming
more enjoyable. I've started to experiment with
different flavors and textures, and I'm surprised
by how much pleasure I can derive from the simple
act of eating. Barry brings me these enormous
meals, and I devour them with gusto, feeling my
body grow softer and more voluptuous with each
passing day.


I've also started to notice changes in my libido.
As my body has grown softer and more rounded, my
sex drive has increased, and I find myself
thinking about sex more and more. Barry's touch is
still exhilarating, but now I'm starting to crave
it, to need it in order to feel complete. It's a
strange kind of dependency, but it's one that I'm
learning to appreciate.


As I look in the mirror, I see a man who is truly
happy, truly at peace. My body may be soft and
rounded, but my heart is full, and my spirit is
soaring. I'm no longer the man I once was, but I'm
something new, something special, and something
truly unique. And as I gaze into Barry's loving
eyes, I know that I'll never be alone again, that
I'll always have his love and acceptance to guide
me on my journey.

**Month 5:**



It's been five months since I've been locked in
this bathroom, and I can barely recognize the
person I've become. My body has transformed in
ways I never thought possible. I've gained so much
weight that I can hardly move without getting
winded, and my joints ache from the strain of
carrying my enormous bulk. But despite the
physical challenges, I've never felt more alive,
more connected to my body and my desires.


Barry's love and admiration have been a constant
source of comfort and inspiration. He's always
there to encourage me, to praise my growing body
and to remind me of my beauty. He's started to use
this amazing lotion on my skin, and it's made me
feel so soft and supple. I love the way he touches
me, the way he explores every inch of my body with
his hands and his lips.


The eating is still a major part of my day, and I
have to say, I'm getting quite good at it. Barry
brings me these enormous meals, and I devour them
with gusto. I've started to enjoy the feeling of
my stomach expanding, of my body growing softer
and more rounded with each passing day. It's a
strange kind of pleasure, but it's one that I've
grown to love.


I've also started to notice changes in my sense of
self. I used to be so focused on my physical
appearance, on maintaining this perfect, muscular
physique. But now, I'm starting to see that
there's more to life than just looks. I'm learning
to appreciate my inner qualities, my kindness, my
empathy, and my sense of humor. Barry's love has
shown me that I'm more than just a body, that I'm
a complex and multifaceted person with so much to
offer.


As I look in the mirror, I see a person who is
truly happy, truly at peace. My body may be soft
and rounded, but my heart is full, and my spirit
is soaring. I'm no longer the man I once was, but
I'm something new, something special, and
something truly unique. And as I gaze into Barry's
loving eyes, I know that I'll never be alone
again, that I'll always have his love and
acceptance to guide me on my journey.


I've started to think about our future together,
about what it will be like when I'm finally
released from this bathroom. Will we be able to go
out in public, or will I be too big, too
noticeable? Will we be able to find clothes that
fit me, or will I have to have them specially
made? There are so many questions, so many
uncertainties, but one thing is clear: I'll always
have Barry by my side, and together, we'll face
whatever challenges come our way.


As I drift off to sleep, surrounded by the
comforts of this bathroom, I feel a sense of
gratitude and wonder. Who would have thought that
being locked in a bathroom, forced to eat and
grow, would be the key to my happiness? It's a
strange and unexpected journey, but it's one that
I'm grateful for, and one that I'll always
treasure.

It's hard to believe it's been six months since
I've been locked in this bathroom. My body has
continued to grow and change in ways I never
thought possible. I've gained even more weight,
and my mobility has become increasingly limited. I
can barely move without getting winded, and my
joints ache from the strain of carrying my
enormous bulk. But despite the physical
challenges, I've never felt more connected to my
body and my desires.


Barry's love and admiration have been a constant
source of comfort and inspiration. He's always
there to encourage me, to praise my growing body
and to remind me of my beauty. He's started to use

me feel so relaxed and pampered. I love the way he
touches me, the way he explores every inch of my
body with his hands and his lips.

I've started to think about the logistics of our
life together. Barry has been making arrangements
for me to have a custom-made wheelchair, one that
will allow me to move around more easily. He's
also been looking into hiring a team of caregivers
to help me with my daily needs. It's a lot to take
in, but I'm grateful for his thoughtfulness and
his dedication to my well-being.


As I drift off to sleep, surrounded by the
comforts of this bathroom, I feel a sense of

trust in Barry's love and to have faith in our
journey together. I'm becoming more confident,
more self-assured, and more at peace with myself.

> and the following month (no repetition) and share his astonishment at the size of each body part as he describes it

🤖 Assistant:
**Month 8:**



I can hardly believe the transformation that has
taken place in my body. As I look at myself, I am
astonished at the sheer size of each body part. My
belly, for instance, is enormous, stretching out
before me like a vast, rounded landscape. It's so
big that I can hardly see my feet, and when I
move, it jiggles and wobbles like a giant bowl of
jelly. I am amazed at how it has grown, how it
seems to have a life of its own.


My thighs, too, are a wonder to behold. They are
like two massive pillars, supporting my enormous
weight and holding me upright. They are so big and
soft that I can hardly feel my knees, and when I
walk, they rub together with a gentle, squelching
sound. I am astonished at how they have expanded,
how they seem to have grown in every direction.


My arms, as well, have undergone a transformation.
They are now like two giant sausages, soft and
floppy and almost impossible to lift. I can hardly
move them without getting winded, and when I do,
they wobble and jiggle like a pair of giant rubber
bands. I am amazed at how they have changed, how
they seem to have lost all their definition and
tone.


Even my face has changed, becoming rounder and
softer, with a gentle, puffy quality that is both
astonishing and delightful. My cheeks are like two
giant balloons, inflated to bursting point, and my
chin is a soft, rounded curve that seems to melt
into my neck. I am amazed at how my features have
shifted, how they seem to have been transformed by
my enormous weight.


As I look at Barry, I see a similar transformation
taking place. His body, too, has grown enormous,
with a vast, rounded belly and giant, soft thighs.
His arms are like two giant pillows, soft and
floppy and almost impossible to lift. And his
face, like mine, has become rounder and softer,
with a gentle, puffy quality that is both
astonishing and delightful.


I am amazed at how we have both changed, how our
bodies have grown and expanded in every direction.
We are like two giant, soft balloons, floating
through life on a sea of food and drink. And yet,
despite the challenges and difficulties that come
with our size, we are happy, truly happy, and at
peace with ourselves and each other.
As I gaze at my reflection, I am struck by the
sheer magnitude of my body. My boy boobs, once a
modest handful, have grown to enormous
proportions, stretching out to the sides like two
giant melons. They are soft and jiggly, with a
delicate, downy covering of hair that adds to
their allure.


My love handles, too, have expanded to incredible
size, forming a pair of massive, rounded curves
that stretch out from my waist like two giant
wings. They are so big and soft that I can hardly
feel my hips, and when I move, they wobble and
jiggle with a gentle, soothing motion.


But it's my butt that is truly the crowning glory
of my body. It's an immense, towering structure
that rises up from my thighs like a giant, rounded
mountain. The butt topper, as Barry calls it, is a
special feature that has developed over time - a
soft, rounded curve of fat that forms a kind of
"top" to my butt, giving it a delightful, rounded
shape.


And then, of course, there's the matter of my
cock. It's a bit of a sad story, really - once a
proud and prominent feature, it's now buried deep
under my fatpad, a tiny, hidden thing that's
almost impossible to find. But despite its
diminutive size, it's still a source of great
pleasure and joy, and Barry loves to play with it,
to tease and tantalize it until I'm gasping with
delight. It's a strange and wonderful thing, this
body of mine - full of surprises and delights, and
always changing, always growing, always evolving
into something new and wonderful.
> now month 9 and Nico's release  (no repetition)

🤖 Assistant:
**Month 9:**



It's hard to believe it's been nine months since
I've been locked in this bathroom. My body has
undergone a transformation of epic proportions,
and I'm barely recognizable as the same person who
started this journey. But as I look in the mirror,
I see a person who is truly happy, truly at peace.
My body may be enormous, but my heart is full, and
my spirit is soaring.


Today is the day that Barry has been preparing me
for - the day of my release. He's been making
arrangements for me to leave the bathroom, to
start a new life outside these walls. I'm excited,
but also nervous - what will the world be like
outside? Will people stare and point at my
enormous body? Will I be able to navigate the
world with ease, or will I struggle to move and
breathe?


Barry has been preparing me for this moment,
teaching me how to use my new body, how to move
and walk and sit. He's shown me how to use a
wheelchair, how to navigate stairs and ramps, and
how to take care of my skin and hair. He's been a
constant source of support and encouragement, and
I don't know what I would do without him.


As I prepare to leave the bathroom, I feel a sense
of trepidation. What will the future hold? Will I
be able to find work, to make friends, to live a
normal life? Or will I be relegated to the fringes
of society, a sideshow attraction to be gawked at
and ridiculed?


But as I look at Barry, I know that I'll be okay.
He'll be with me every step of the way, supporting
me and loving me no matter what. And as we leave
the bathroom together, I feel a sense of
excitement and wonder. What will the future hold?
Only time will tell, but for now, I'm just happy
to be alive, to be loved, and to be free.


As we make our way through the house, I'm struck
by the sheer scale of everything. The furniture
seems smaller, the doors narrower, and the stairs
steeper. But with Barry by my side, I feel like I
can conquer anything. We'll face the world
together, as a team, and we'll make it work.


And as we step out into the bright sunlight, I
feel a sense of joy and wonder. The world is a big
and scary place, but with Barry by my side, I know
that I can handle anything. I'm ready to take on
the world, to explore and discover and experience
all the wonders that it has to offer. I'm ready to
live, to love, and to be free.

🤖 Assistant:
**The Discovery:**



As I stepped out into the bright sunlight, I felt
a sense of excitement and wonder. The world was a
big and scary place, but with Barry by my side, I
knew that I could handle anything. I was ready to
take on the world, to explore and discover and
experience all the wonders that it had to offer.


But as I began to move around, I realized that I
didn't need the wheelchair that Barry had been
preparing me for. Despite my enormous size, my
muscles were still there, strong and capable,
underneath all the new blubber. I could walk,
albeit slowly and carefully, and I could even move
around with a degree of ease.


It was a surprising discovery, and one that filled
me with a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had
been worried that I would be confined to a
wheelchair, unable to move around or experience
the world in the same way that I had before. But
now, I realized that I was still capable, still
strong, and still able to take care of myself.


However, as I began to navigate the world with my
new size, I quickly realized that it wasn't going
to be easy. Doors were too narrow, chairs were too
small, and stairs were too steep. I struggled to
fit through doorways, and I had to be careful not
to get stuck in tight spaces.


I also attracted a lot of attention, with people
staring and pointing at my enormous body. Some of
them were kind and curious, while others were rude
and cruel. I tried to ignore them, to focus on my
own journey and my own happiness, but it was hard
to do.


Barry was a constant source of support and
encouragement, helping me to navigate the
challenges of my new size and reminding me that I
was still the same person, no matter what my body
looked like. He held my hand, literally and
figuratively, as we made our way through the
world, and he helped me to see that I was still
capable, still strong, and still worthy of love
and respect.


Together, we faced the challenges of my new size,
and we found ways to overcome them. We learned to
navigate the world in new and creative ways, using
ramps and elevators and finding alternative routes
when necessary. We also learned to ignore the
stares and the comments, to focus on our own
happiness and our own love for each other.


It wasn't always easy, but with Barry by my side,
I knew that I could handle anything. I was ready
to take on the world, to explore and discover and
experience all the wonders that it had to offer.
And I was ready to do it with the person I loved,
the person who loved me for who I was, no matter
what my body looked like.

**The Confession:**



As we settled in for the night, Barry turned to me
with a curious expression. "Nico, can I ask you
something?" he said, his voice low and gentle.


I looked at him, feeling a sense of trepidation.
"What is it?" I asked, trying to sound nonchalant.


Barry's eyes locked onto mine, and I could see the
hint of a smile playing on his lips. "I've noticed
that you haven't been jerking off lately," he
said, his voice barely above a whisper. "Is
everything okay?"


I felt a flush rise to my cheeks as I realized
that Barry had been paying attention to my habits.
I had been trying to avoid the subject, hoping
that he wouldn't notice my struggles.


But Barry's eyes were piercing, and I knew that I
couldn't avoid the truth any longer. "I...I
haven't been able to reach it," I admitted,
feeling a sense of embarrassment and shame.


Barry's expression changed from curiosity to
surprise, and then to a hint of excitement. "You
mean, you can't reach your cock?" he asked, his
voice filled with a mix of concern and arousal.


I nodded, feeling my face grow even hotter. "Yeah,
I just can't seem to reach it anymore," I said,
trying to sound casual despite the fact that I was
mortified.


Barry's eyes sparkled with excitement as he leaned
in closer to me. "Try," he whispered, his voice
filled with a sense of urgency.


I looked at him, feeling a sense of confusion and
embarrassment. "What do you mean?" I asked, trying
to stall for time.


Barry's eyes locked onto mine, and I could see the
hint of a challenge in his gaze. "I mean, try to
reach your cock," he said, his voice firm but
gentle. "I want to see you try."


I felt a sense of frustration and embarrassment as
I realized that Barry was serious. I didn't want
to try, didn't want to struggle and fail in front
of him. But at the same time, I couldn't resist
the excitement in his eyes, the sense of arousal
that seemed to emanate from him like a palpable
force.


With a sense of trepidation, I reached down,
trying to stretch my arms and fingers to reach my
cock. It was a futile effort, and I knew it from
the start. My belly was too big, my arms too
short, and my cock was too far away.


But I tried, oh how I tried. I strained and
stretched, my face growing hotter and hotter as I
realized that I was never going to make it. Barry
watched me, his eyes fixed on my struggles, and I
could see the excitement building in his gaze.


And then, just as I was about to give up, Barry
let out a sudden gasp. His eyes went wide, and his
body began to shake. I looked up at him, confused,
and that's when I saw it - a spontaneous orgasm,
triggered by my struggles to reach my own cock.


I felt a mix of emotions - embarrassment,
frustration, and a hint of arousal. I had never
seen Barry come like that before, and it was both
shocking and thrilling. As I looked at him, I
realized that my struggles had turned him on, that
my inability to reach my own cock had become a
source of excitement and pleasure for him.


It was a strange and confusing feeling, but as I
looked into Barry's eyes, I knew that I was
willing to try again, to struggle and fail in
front of him, just to see that look of excitement
and arousal on his face.

**The Repeat Performance:**



Two weeks had passed since my last attempt to
reach my cock, and I had grown even fatter in that
time. My belly was now a massive, jiggling expanse
of flesh that seemed to have a life of its own. My
thighs were like two giant pillars, soft and
rounded, and my arms were short and stubby, barely
able to reach past my hips.


Barry had been watching me with an intense gaze,
his eyes burning with excitement and arousal. He
had been waiting for me to try again, to see if I
could reach my cock now that I was even fatter.


I began by lying on my back, my belly jiggling and
quivering as I lifted my arms and tried to reach
down. My blubber shifted and reshaped itself,
forming a series of rolling hills and valleys as I
strained and stretched. My cock was still just out
of reach, but I could feel my belly fat rippling
and flowing like a liquid as I moved.


Undeterred, I tried a new position, rolling onto
my side and attempting to reach down with my arm.
My blubber flowed and shifted, forming a giant,
rounded bulge that seemed to pulse and throb with
every movement. My arm was still too short, but I
could feel my belly fat jiggling and quivering as
I strained and stretched.


Next, I tried using a sex toy, a long, curved
dildo that I hoped would allow me to reach my
cock. I inserted the dildo into my belly fat,
feeling it slide and glide through the soft,
yielding flesh. My blubber reshaped itself around
the toy, forming a series of tight, rounded folds
that seemed to grip and release the dildo with
every movement.


As I moved the dildo in and out of my belly fat, I
could feel my cock stirring, responding to the
sensation of the toy rubbing against my skin. But
even with the dildo, I still couldn't quite reach
my cock, and I was forced to try another position.


I rolled onto my stomach, my belly fat flowing and
shifting as I moved. My blubber formed a giant,
rounded bulge that seemed to pulse and throb with
every movement, and I could feel my cock stirring,
responding to the sensation of my belly fat
rubbing against the floor.


I tried to reach down with my arm, but it was
still too short, and I was forced to use my other
arm to try and lift my belly fat out of the way.
My blubber flowed and shifted, forming a series of
tight, rounded folds that seemed to grip and
release my arm as I moved.


As I struggled and strained, my belly fat jiggling
and quivering with every movement, I could feel
Barry's eyes on me, burning with excitement and
arousal. He was loving every minute of this, and I
could sense his pleasure and enjoyment as I
continued to try and reach my cock.


Finally, in a last-ditch effort, I tried using a
combination of sex toys and contortions to reach
my cock. I inserted a dildo into my belly fat, and
then used a vibrator to stimulate my cock, hoping
that the combination of sensations would allow me
to finally reach my goal.


My blubber flowed and shifted, forming a series of
tight, rounded folds that seemed to grip and
release the dildo and vibrator as I moved. My
belly fat jiggled and quivered, pulsing and
throbbing with every movement, and I could feel my
cock stirring, responding to the sensation of the
toys rubbing against my skin.


As I struggled and strained, my belly fat flowing
and shifting with every movement, I could feel
Barry's pleasure and enjoyment reaching a fever
pitch. He was loving every minute of this, and I
could sense his excitement and arousal as I
continued to try and reach my cock.


And then, in a sudden, shocking moment, Barry let
out a loud cry of pleasure, his body shaking and
trembling as he came. I looked up at him,
surprised and amazed, and saw that he was covered
in sweat, his eyes glazed over with pleasure.


I had done it, I had finally managed to turn Barry
on, and it had been worth all the struggle and
effort. As I lay there, my belly fat jiggling and
quivering with every movement, I knew that I would
do it all again, just to see the look of pleasure
and enjoyment on Barry's face.

**The New Ritual:**



It's been a few weeks since I've been trying to
reach my cock, and Barry has developed a new
ritual that has become a regular part of our
routine. He's started jerking me off, but only
when I'm so full that I'm semi-comatose.


It's a strange and wonderful feeling, being so
full that I can barely move or think. My belly is
like a giant, bloated balloon, stretching out my
skin and making me feel like I'm going to burst at
any moment. My thighs are like two giant pillows,
soft and rounded, and my arms are like short,
stubby logs that can't even lift themselves off
the bed.


But despite the discomfort and the lethargy, I'm
incredibly turned on. There's something about
being so full that just makes me feel like I'm
going to explode with pleasure. My cock is hard
and throbbing, and my balls are tight and aching.
I can feel my cum building up inside me, just
waiting to be released.


Barry knows exactly when I'm at my fullest, and
that's when he starts to jerk me off. He's gentle
at first, just lightly stroking my cock with his
fingers. But as I start to respond, he gets more
and more aggressive, pumping his fist up and down
my shaft and making me feel like I'm going to lose
my mind.


I'm so full that I can barely breathe, but I don't
care. I'm too busy feeling the pleasure that's
building up inside me. My belly is jiggling and
quivering with every movement, and my thighs are
shaking and trembling. I can feel my cum building
up inside me, just waiting to be released.


As Barry jerks me off, I can feel my body starting
to respond. My cock is getting harder and harder,
and my balls are getting tighter and tighter. I
can feel my cum building up inside me, just
waiting to be released.


And then, in a sudden, shocking moment, I come.
It's like a tidal wave of pleasure, washing over
me and making me feel like I'm going to drown in
my own cum. I'm so full that I can barely breathe,
but I don't care. I'm too busy feeling the
pleasure that's building up inside me.


As I lay there, my belly still jiggling and
quivering with every movement, I know that I'm
exactly where I'm meant to be. I'm full, I'm
happy, and I'm turned on. And as Barry looks at me
with a smile on his face, I know that he's happy
too.


This is our new ritual, and I couldn't be more
grateful. I'm so full, and I'm so happy, and I
know that I'll never get tired of this feeling.
I'm exactly where I'm meant to be, and I know that
I'll always be happy, as long as Barry is by my
side.
**The Agony of Separation:**



Barry had left town for a few days, and I was left
to my own devices. It was a miserable feeling,
knowing that I wouldn't be able to experience the
pleasure of an orgasm for a while. Barry was the
only one who could bring me to climax, and without
him, I was left feeling frustrated and
unfulfilled.


But despite the misery, I couldn't help myself. I
continued to gorge on food, eating incredible
quantities of everything in sight. It was like I
was trying to fill the void left by Barry's
absence, and the only way I knew how to do that
was to eat.


The first day was the worst. I felt like I was
going to explode from frustration, and the only
thing that seemed to calm me down was eating. I
ate and ate, stuffing my face with pizza, burgers,
and fries. My belly grew bigger and bigger, and I
could feel my fat spreading out in all directions.


The second day was just as bad. I woke up feeling
miserable and bloated, and the only thing that
seemed to make me feel better was eating more. I
ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and then I ate
some more. My belly was getting bigger and bigger,
and I could feel my fat jiggling and quivering
with every movement.


But it wasn't until the third day that something
strange happened. I had been eating nonstop all
day, and my belly was so full that I could barely
move. I was lying on the bed, feeling like I was
going to burst at any moment, when suddenly I felt
a strange sensation.


It started in my belly, a warm, tingling feeling
that spread out in all directions. It was like my
fat was alive, and it was moving and quivering of
its own accord. I felt my cock start to harden,
and my balls began to tighten. I was getting an
orgasm, and it was all because of my extreme
fatness.


I couldn't believe it. I had never had a
spontaneous orgasm before, and I didn't know what
to do. I just lay there, feeling the pleasure wash
over me, and let out a loud cry of ecstasy.


As I came, I felt my belly jiggling and quivering
with every movement. My fat was like a living,
breathing thing, and it was responding to my
orgasm in a way that I had never experienced
before. I felt like I was going to explode, and
the pleasure was so intense that I thought I might
pass out.


But as the orgasm subsided, I was left feeling
drained and exhausted. I had never felt so full
and so fat in my life, and I didn't know how much
more of this I could take. But at the same time, I
couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and
anticipation. What would happen next? Would I
continue to get spontaneous orgasms from my
extreme fatness? Only time would tell.

**The Quest for Repeat:**



For the next five days, I tried to repeat the
stuffing-induced orgasm that I had experienced on
the third day of Barry's absence. I ate and ate,
consuming massive amounts of food in an attempt to
recreate the conditions that had led to my
spontaneous climax.


But no matter how much I ate, I couldn't seem to
repeat the experience. Instead, I found myself
falling in and out of a food-induced coma, my body
unable to handle the sheer quantity of calories
that I was consuming.


I would eat and eat, feeling my belly grow bigger
and bigger, until I would finally collapse from
exhaustion. I would sleep for hours, my body
comatose from the sheer amount of food that I had
consumed.


And then, I would wake up, feeling groggy and
disoriented, and start the cycle all over again. I
would eat and eat, trying to recreate the
conditions that had led to my orgasm, but it was
no use.


As the days passed, I began to feel like I was
losing myself in a sea of food. I was no longer in
control, and my body was dictating my every move.
I would eat and eat, until I was so full that I
couldn't move, and then I would collapse,
exhausted.


I knew that I needed to stop, that I was pushing
my body to its limits, but I couldn't seem to help
myself. I was addicted to the feeling of being
full, of being stuffed to the brim with food, and
I couldn't seem to break the cycle.


As the days turned into a blur, I found myself
losing all sense of time and space. I was trapped
in a never-ending cycle of eating and sleeping,
and I didn't know how to escape.


And then, just when I thought that things couldn't
get any worse, I received a call from Barry. He
was on his way back home, and he would be arriving
in just a few hours.


I was in a panic, knowing that I had to get myself
together before he arrived. But as I looked in the
mirror, I saw a person who was barely
recognizable. My belly was enormous, my skin was
pale and clammy, and my eyes were sunken and
tired.


I knew that I had to do something, but I didn't
know what. All I could do was wait, and hope that
Barry would be able to help me break the cycle of
addiction that I had fallen into.

**Barry's Shock and Arousal:**



As Barry walked into the room, he was met with a
sight that left him breathless. I was sitting on
the bed, my enormous body sprawled out in every
direction. Barry's eyes widened in shock as he
took in the sheer scale of my new size.


"Nico, my god," Barry whispered, his voice
trembling with excitement. "You're...you're so
much bigger."


I looked down at myself, feeling a mix of
emotions. I was still getting used to my new size,
and it was strange to see myself through Barry's
eyes.


Barry's gaze roamed over my body, taking in every
new curve and contour. "Your boy boobs are
enormous," he said, his voice filled with wonder.
"They're like two giant melons, stretching out
your skin and making you look like a completely
different person."


As he spoke, Barry's eyes moved down to my belly,
which was now a massive, rounded expanse of flesh.
"Your belly is incredible," he breathed. "It's
like a giant beach ball, stretching out your skin
and making you look like you're about to burst."


Barry's gaze then moved to my love handles, which
were now two giant, rounded curves of flesh that
stretched out from my waist like two giant wings.
"Your love handles are amazing," he said, his
voice filled with excitement. "They're so big and
soft, and they make you look like a completely
different person."


As Barry continued to explore my body, his eyes
landed on my fat pad, which was now a massive,
rounded expanse of flesh that stretched out from
my pubic area like a giant, fleshy mound. "Your
fat pad is incredible," he breathed. "It's like a
giant pillow, soft and squishy and utterly
irresistible."


Barry's gaze then moved to my thighs, which were
now two giant, rounded pillars of flesh that
stretched out from my hips like two giant tree
trunks. "Your thighs are amazing," he said, his
voice filled with wonder. "They're so big and
soft, and they make you look like a completely
different person."


Finally, Barry's eyes landed on my butt, which was
now a massive, rounded expanse of flesh that
stretched out from my backside like a giant,
fleshy moon. "Your butt is incredible," he
breathed. "It's like a giant, rounded cushion,
soft and squishy and utterly irresistible."


As Barry continued to explore my body, I could
feel his sexual arousal growing. He was clearly
turned on by my new size, and I could sense his
excitement and desire.


"I need to touch you," Barry whispered, his voice
trembling with excitement. "I need to feel your
new body, to explore every curve and contour."


I nodded, feeling a sense of anticipation and
excitement. I knew that Barry was going to take me
on a journey of discovery, one that would explore
every inch of my new body and leave us both
breathless and satisfied.

🤖 Assistant:
**Nico's Confession:**



As Barry's hands began to explore my new body, I
felt a sense of vulnerability wash over me. I knew
that I had to confess the truth behind my weight
gain, the spontaneous orgasm, and the failed quest
for another.


"Barry, I have to tell you something," I said, my
voice barely above a whisper. "I've been eating
nonstop since you left. I couldn't control myself,
and I just kept going. I think it's because I was
trying to fill the void you left behind."


Barry's hands paused on my skin, and he looked at
me with a mixture of surprise and concern. "Oh,
Nico, I had no idea," he said. "But what about the
orgasm? You said you had a spontaneous one while I
was away."


I nodded, feeling a sense of embarrassment. "Yes,
it happened on the third day. I was so full, and
my body just seemed to take over. It was like
nothing I've ever experienced before. But then I
tried to repeat it, and I failed. I've been trying
for days, but it just won't happen again."


Barry's expression softened, and he leaned in to
kiss me. "It's okay, Nico. I'm here now, and we'll
figure this out together. But I have to ask, what
was it like? The orgasm, I mean."


I closed my eyes, remembering the sensation. "It
was like my body was on fire," I said. "Every
nerve ending was tingling, and I felt like I was
going to explode. It was like nothing I've ever
felt before. And the weirdest part is, it wasn't
just about the pleasure. It was like my body was
trying to tell me something, like it was trying to
wake me up to something new."


Barry's eyes sparkled with curiosity, and he
leaned in closer. "I think I understand," he said.
"I think your body is trying to tell you that it's
capable of more than you ever thought possible.
And I'm here to help you explore that, to help you
discover what your body is truly capable of."
