DADDY: Hey there, Sammy! How was your day, sweetheart? SAMMY: Oh, hey, Daddy! My day was
great, just thinking about all the treats you have for me. DADDY: I've got a whole spread
ready for you, my plump little cutie. Let's get you nice and stuffed. SAMMY: Mmm, stuffed
like a Thanksgiving turkey! Can't wait to see these curves grow even more. DADDY: That's
my chubby darling! Let's start with some mac and cheese, your favorite. SAMMY: Mac and
cheese? More like mac and squeeze into my fat rolls! Bring it on, Daddy. DADDY: Watching
you indulge is such a delight, Sammy. Here's a big spoonful just for you. SAMMY: *slurps
up the mac and cheese* Ah, pure bliss! Can feel the pounds piling on already. DADDY: You
look so content with a full belly, my dear. Ready for dessert? I made your favorite pie.
SAMMY: Always ready for dessert, especially when it means adding more jiggle to my wobble.
Bring on the pie! DADDY: Here you go, sweet Sammy. Dig in and let that sugary goodness
make you even plumper. SAMMY: *devours the pie* Mmm, this pie is magical! Can feel it
transforming into more padding for you to squish. DADDY: Your dedication to growing for me
is truly enchanting, my little piggy. Let's keep those scales climbing. SAMMY: Oh, you
know I'm dedicated to gaining for you, Daddy! These rolls aren't going to grow themselves.
DADDY: And I love every inch of those growing rolls, Sammy. Let's plan our next feast
together. SAMMY: Planning feasts is my favorite hobby! Can't wait to see what delightful
delights you have in store for me. DADDY: Your enthusiasm for gaining is infectious, my
plumpkins. I'm excited to watch you blossom even more. SAMMY: Blossom? More like bloom
into a full-fledged blubber ball! Can't wait for you to see me fully stuffed. DADDY: I
adore your playful spirit, Sammy. And I can't wait to see you reach your fullest, roundest
potential. SAMMY: My fullest, roundest potential? Sounds like a dream come true! Can't
wait to waddle around for you, Daddy. DADDY: Seeing you waddle with all that extra weight
will be such a joy, my chubby cherub. Let's make it happen, one bite at a time. SAMMY: One
bite at a time, one pound at a time, until I'm your ultimate chunky monkey! Let's keep
this fattening journey going, Daddy. DADDY: You're my ultimate chunky monkey, Sammy, and I
wouldn't have it any other way. Let's keep growing together, my love. SAMMY: Growing
together, growing fatter together! It's a dream come true, Daddy. Can't wait to see what's
next on the menu.
