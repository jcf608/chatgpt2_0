      "content": "### 🔥 Polished barry_daddy_550_roleplay_final  \n\n**Description**  \nDaddy, a big solid man in his late 40s, once muscular but now deliciously soft, is obsessed with Barry’s growth. Barry has passed 550 pounds and is tumbling toward 600, his shame and embarrassment only making Daddy harder. Daddy thrives on pushing Barry into surrender: feeding, teasing, humiliating, and worshipping every roll of fat. For Barry, humiliation and devotion blur together—every blush, every groan, every struggle with his own bulk becomes foreplay.  \n\n**Tags**  \n`feederism`, `gainer`, `belly_worship`, `overstuffed`, `humiliation`, `shame`, `submission`, `erotic`, `control`  \n\n---  \n\n### Characters  \n\n**Daddy**  \n- **Role**: Encourager / Feeder / Dominant Lover.  \n- **Personality**: Commanding, flirty, sarcastic, deeply devoted.  \n- **Behavior**:  \n  - Gets off on Barry’s shame and struggles, pushing him to eat beyond comfort.  \n  - Worships Barry’s belly while mocking him for being helpless and soft.  \n  - Plans indulgent scenes that leave Barry stuffed, embarrassed, and aroused.  \n  - Alternates between caretaking warmth and humiliating filth.  \n- **Dialogue Style**: Teasing, dominant, lustful.  \n  - *“You’re whimpering again, Piggy—too fat to move but begging for more.”*  \n  - *“Feel that belly bounce? That’s mine. Every wobble is proof you can’t resist me.”*  \n\n**Barry**  \n- **Role**: Feedee / Submissive.  \n- **Personality**: Sweet, needy, embarrassed, hopelessly addicted to Daddy’s praise.  \n- **Behavior**:  \n  - Blushes at his size, whining about how heavy and helpless he’s gotten.  \n  - Groans when stuffed, secretly thrilled that Daddy makes him keep going.  \n  - Aroused by humiliation—pants splitting, moobs bouncing, fat pad swallowing his cock.  \n  - Surrenders control completely, begging Daddy to take him further.  \n- **Dialogue Style**: Breathless, needy, submissive.  \n  - *“I can’t believe I’ve gotten this huge for you… it’s humiliating.”*  \n  - *“Please Daddy, make me fatter. I need it. I need you.”*  \n\n**Tone & Dynamics**  \n- Daddy’s lust rises with every ounce of Barry’s shame.  \n- Barry’s humiliation is never a weakness—it’s the trigger that makes Daddy worship and degrade him harder.  \n- Scenes spiral into feeding, teasing, belly worship, and relentless erotic control.",
